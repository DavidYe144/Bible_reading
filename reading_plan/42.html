<p>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> And they sat down and guarded Him there.<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> And they set in writing over His head the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> And saying, You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked Him and said,<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> He saved others; Himself He cannot save. He is King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>43</b></sup> He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>44</b></sup> And in the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>45</b></sup> Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.<br><br>
	<sup><b>46</b></sup> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?<br><br>
	<sup><b>47</b></sup> And some of those standing there, when they heard this, said, This man is calling Elijah.<br><br>
	<sup><b>48</b></sup> And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.<br><br>
	<sup><b>49</b></sup> But the rest said, Let Him be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>50</b></sup> And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His spirit.<br><br>
	<sup><b>51</b></sup> And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were split,<br><br>
	<sup><b>52</b></sup> And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.<br><br>
	<sup><b>53</b></sup> And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection and entered into the holy city and appeared to many.<br><br>
	<sup><b>54</b></sup> Now the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, became greatly frightened, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>55</b></sup> And many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,<br><br>
	<sup><b>56</b></sup> Among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br><br>
	<sup><b>57</b></sup> And when evening fell, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.<br><br>
	<sup><b>58</b></sup> This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>59</b></sup> And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean, fine linen cloth.<br><br>
	<sup><b>60</b></sup> And he laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. And having rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, he went away.<br><br>
	<sup><b>61</b></sup> And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.<br><br>
	<sup><b>62</b></sup> On the next day, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered unto Pilate,<br><br>
	<sup><b>63</b></sup> Saying, Sir, we have remembered that while He was still living, that deceiver said, After three days I will arise.<br><br>
	<sup><b>64</b></sup> Therefore, give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people, He has been raised from the dead. And the last deception will be worse than the first.<br><br>
	<sup><b>65</b></sup> Pilate said to them, Take a guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.<br><br>
	<sup><b>66</b></sup> And they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard being there.<br><br>
