  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now in the things which are being said the chief point is this: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For every high priest is established for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this One also have something which He may offer.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Now then if He were on earth, He would not be a Priest at all, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Who serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, “See,” He said, “that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For finding fault with them He says, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> In saying, A new covenant, He has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing. <br><br>
