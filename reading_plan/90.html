	<p>				 
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And His mother and brothers came up to Him and were not able to get to Him because of the crowd.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And it was reported to Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wanting to see You.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And on one of the days He and His disciples got into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down upon the lake, and they began to fill with water and were in danger.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And being awakened, He rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And they sailed down to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met Him, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For He had charged the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet every time he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And they entreated Him not to order them to depart into the abyss.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Now there was a herd of many hogs feeding there on the mountain. And they entreated Him to permit them to enter into them, and He gave them permission.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And the demons came out from the man and entered into the hogs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And when those who were feeding them saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the people went out to see what had happened. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sane, and they became frightened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And all the multitude from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And the man from whom the demons had come out begged to be with Him, but He sent him away, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> Return to your house, and relate what great things God has done for you. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.<br><br>
