	<p><sup><b>22</b></sup> Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord;<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word,<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Because we are members of His Body.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way love your own wife as yourself; and the wife should fear her husband. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> “Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with a promise,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> “That it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Not with eye-service as men-pleasers but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul;<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> With good will serving as slaves, as serving the Lord and not men;<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or a free man.<br><br>
