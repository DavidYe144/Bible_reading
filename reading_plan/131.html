	<p>				 
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form,<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> I do not receive glory from men.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?<br><br>
