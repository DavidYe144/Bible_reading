	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them rods, one for each father’s house, twelve rods from all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses; you shall write everyone’s name upon his rod.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head <i>of each</i> of their fathers’ houses.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And you shall place them in the Tent of Meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And the rod of the man whom I choose shall bud, and I will put a stop to the murmurings of the children of Israel against Me, which they murmur against you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. And every one of their leaders gave him a rod, one rod for each leader according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah in the Tent of the Testimony.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and there was the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi: it had budded; it even put forth buds and produced blossoms and bore ripe almonds.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked; and each one took his rod.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the Testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, so that you may put an end to their murmurings against Me, and they not die.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And Moses did <i>so;</i> just as Jehovah commanded him, so he did.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Alas, we die out; we perish; all of us perish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dies. Are we to completely die out?<br><br>
