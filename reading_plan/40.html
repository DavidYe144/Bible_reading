	<p><sup><b>47</b></sup> And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> And immediately he came to Jesus and said, Rejoice, Rabbi, and kissed Him affectionately.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Friend, what are you here for? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> Or do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> But all this has happened in order that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left Him and fled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> And those who seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> And Peter followed Him at a distance to the courtyard of the high priest; and entering within, he sat with the attendants to see the end.<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put Him to death,<br><br>
		<sup><b>60</b></sup> And they did not find it, though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came<br><br>
		<sup><b>61</b></sup> And said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>62</b></sup> And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it that these testify against You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>63</b></sup> But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>64</b></sup> Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>65</b></sup> Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.<br><br>
		<sup><b>66</b></sup> What do you think? And they answered and said, He is worthy of death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>67</b></sup> Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>68</b></sup> Saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who hit You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>69</b></sup> Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.<br><br>
		<sup><b>70</b></sup> But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!<br><br>
		<sup><b>71</b></sup> And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.<br><br>
		<sup><b>72</b></sup> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!<br><br>
		<sup><b>73</b></sup> And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.<br><br>
		<sup><b>74</b></sup> Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>75</b></sup> And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.<br><br>
