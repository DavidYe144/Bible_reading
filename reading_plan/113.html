	<p>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And as He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount which is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Saying, Go into the village opposite you, in which, as you are entering, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat; untie it and lead it here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? thus shall you say, Because the Lord has need of it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And those who were sent went away and found it even as He had told them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And as they were untying the colt, its masters said to them, Why are you untying the colt?<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And they brought it to Jesus. And when they had thrown their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And as He went, they spread their own garments in the road.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And as He was already drawing near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> Saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And He answered and said, I tell you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Saying, If you knew in this day, even you, the things that are for your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a rampart before you, and will encircle you, and will press you in on every side,<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> And He entered into the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> Saying to them, It is written, “And My house shall be a house of prayer,” but you have made it a den of robbers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And He taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him;<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Yet they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging upon Him, listening. <br><br>
