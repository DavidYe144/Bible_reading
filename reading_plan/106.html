	<p>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said, A certain man had two sons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me. And he distributed to them his living.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered everything together, went abroad to a distant country and there squandered his estate by living dissolutely.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And when he had spent all, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he began to be in want.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And he longed to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine!<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And he rose up and came to his own father.        But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found. And they began to be merry.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing,<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And calling to him one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back healthy.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But he became angry and was not willing to enter. And his father came out and entreated him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends;<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> But when this son of yours came, who devoured your living with harlots, you slaughtered for him the fattened calf.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> But we had to be merry and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life, and he was lost and has been found. <br><br>
