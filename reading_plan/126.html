	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to him, You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and yet you do not receive our testimony.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> That everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> For everyone who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.<br><br>
