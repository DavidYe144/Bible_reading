	<h4 id="Acts-1"><a onclick="open_chapter('13', '../bible/44-Acts.html')">Acts 13:24</a></h4>
	<p><sup><b>24</b></sup> After John had proclaimed, prior to His public entrance, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> Now as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us the word of this salvation has been sent forth.<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> For those dwelling in Jerusalem and their rulers, being ignorant of this One and of the words of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by judging Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> And though they did not find one cause of death in Him, they asked of Pilate that He be done away with.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> And when they had accomplished all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> But God raised Him from the dead.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> And for many days He appeared to those who had come up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> And we announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers,<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, “You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, “I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> Therefore He also says in another place, “You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption;<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> But He whom God has raised did not see corruption.<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you;<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> Therefore beware that what is spoken in the prophets does not come upon you:<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> “Look, you despisers, and marvel, and vanish away; for I am doing a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though someone tells it to you in detail.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> And as Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words would be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.<br><br>
	<sup><b>43</b></sup> And when the synagogue gathering had been dismissed, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.<br><br>
