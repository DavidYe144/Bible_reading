	<p>				 
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> But I have said to you that you have also seen Me, and yet you do not believe.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.<br><br>
