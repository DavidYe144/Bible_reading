	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> For you yourselves know perfectly well that like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> But you, brothers, are not in darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> So then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For those who sleep, sleep during the night, and those who get drunk are drunk during the night;<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and a helmet, the hope of salvation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> For God did not appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Who died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Therefore comfort one another, and build up each one the other, even as you also do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Furthermore we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord and admonish you,<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And to regard them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And we exhort you, brothers, Admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak, be long-suffering toward all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always pursue what is good both for one another and for all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Always rejoice,<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Unceasingly pray,<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Do not quench the Spirit;<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Do not despise prophecies,<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But prove all things. Hold fast to what is good;<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Abstain from every kind of evil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Brothers, pray also for us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <br><br>
