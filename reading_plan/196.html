	<p>				 
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And he directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and that he should have some liberty and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But after some days, Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Hoping at the same time also that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And when two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews gave their information to him against Paul; and they entreated him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, they themselves setting an ambush to do away with him on the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Therefore, he said, let influential men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> While Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.<br><br>
