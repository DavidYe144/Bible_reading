		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And a contention also occurred among them as to which of them seemed to be greatest.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But you are those who have remained with Me throughout My trials.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And I appoint to you, even as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again, establish your brothers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> But He said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you? And they said, Nothing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And He said to them, But now, let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> For I tell you that this which is written must be accomplished in Me, “And He was counted with the lawless.” For indeed that which concerns Me has its fulfillment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And He came out and went according to His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet, not My will, but Yours be done.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And being in agony He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> And when He rose up from prayer and came to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow,<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> And those around Him, seeing what would happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> But Jesus answered and said, Let them go this far. And touching his ear, He healed him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come up against Him, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> While I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> And having arrested Him, they led Him away, and brought Him into the house of the high priest.        But Peter followed at a distance.<br><br>
