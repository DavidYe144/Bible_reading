	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He entered and was passing through Jericho.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was, and could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And as they were listening to these things, He spoke further a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> He said therefore, A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten minas, and he said to them, Do business until I come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And when he came back, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those slaves to whom he had given the money should be called to him so that he might know what they had gained by doing business.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And the first appeared, saying, Master, your mina has gained ten minas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And he said to him, Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And the second came, saying, Your mina, master, has made five minas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And he said to this one as well, And you, be over five cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And the other came, saying, Master, behold your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> He said to him, Out of your mouth I will judge you, wicked slave. You knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And to those standing by he said, Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> However, these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.<br><br>
