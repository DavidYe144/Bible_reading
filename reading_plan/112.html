  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming and now is already in the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> They are of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And we have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> In this has love been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of the judgment because even as He is, so also are we in this world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear because fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been perfected in love.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> We love because He first loved us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also. <br><br>
