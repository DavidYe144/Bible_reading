	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different Priest should arise according to the order of Melchizedek and that He should not be said to be according to the order of Aaron?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has attended to the altar.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And it is still more abundantly evident since it is according to the likeness of Melchizedek that a different Priest arises,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For it is testified, “You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For there is, on the one hand, the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> (For the law perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.<br><br>
