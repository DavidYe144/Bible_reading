	<p>				 
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But if I am to live in the flesh, if this to me is fruit for my work, then I do not know what I will choose.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> But I am constrained between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for this is far better;<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith,<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> That your boast may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my coming again to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel,<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And in nothing being frightened by the opposers, which is to them a proof of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Because to you it has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe into Him but also to suffer on His behalf,<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear to be in me. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men;<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.<br><br>
