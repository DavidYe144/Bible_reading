	<p>	<sup><b>29</b></sup> And immediately, going out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and immediately they told Him about her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And He came to her and raised her up, holding her hand, and the fever left her, and she served them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And the whole city was gathered together at the door.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And rising very early in the morning, while it was still night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And Simon and those with him hunted for Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And they found Him and said to Him, All are seeking You.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And He said to them, Let us go elsewhere into the nearby towns that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I came out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And He went preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee and casting out the demons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And a leper came to Him, entreating Him and falling on his knees and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can cleanse me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And sternly charging him, immediately He thrust him out,<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to spread the matter abroad, so that He could no longer enter openly into a city, but He stayed outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from everywhere. <br><br>
