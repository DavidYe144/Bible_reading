  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But you, speak the things which are fitting to the healthy teaching.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Exhort older men to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Older women likewise to be in demeanor as befits those who engage in sacred things, not slanderers, nor enslaved by much wine, teachers of what is good,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> That they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> To be of a sober mind, pure, workers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The younger men likewise exhort to be of a sober mind,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Concerning all things presenting yourself as a pattern of good works: in your teaching showing incorruption, gravity,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Healthy speech that cannot be condemned, that he who opposes may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Exhort slaves to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Not pilfering, but showing all good faithfulness that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For the grace of God, bringing salvation to all men, has appeared,<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> These things speak, and exhort and convict with all authority. Let no one despise you. <br><br>
