	<p>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to Him a blind man and entreated Him to touch him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And He took hold of the hand of the blind man and led him forth outside the village. And He spat on his eyes and laid His hands on him and asked him, Do you see anything?<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And he looked up and said, I see men, for I see them as trees, walking.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes, and the man looked intently and was restored, and he began to see all things clearly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And He sent him to his house, saying, Do not even enter into the village.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And Jesus and His disciples went out into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And they told Him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And He questioned them, But you, who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ!<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And He charged them not to tell anyone concerning Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And He spoke this word openly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> But turning around and looking at His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And He called the crowd to Him with His disciples and said to them, If anyone wants to follow after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel’s shall save it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul-life?<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> For what could a man give in exchange for his soul-life?<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels. <br><br>
