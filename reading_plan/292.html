	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> By means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if received with thanksgiving;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> For it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> If you lay these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> For to this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Charge and teach these things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Until I come, attend to the public reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Practice these things; be in them, that your progress may be manifest to all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; continue in these things; for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you. <br><br>
