	<p>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> By faith Jacob, while he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped God, while leaning on the top of his staff.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that the child was lovely, and they did not fear the king’s decree.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the reward.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he persevered as one seeing the unseen One.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> By faith he instituted the Passover and the pouring out of the blood so that the one destroying the firstborn would not touch them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, in which the Egyptians, while making the attempt, were swallowed up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for a period of seven days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, since she had received the spies with peace.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Who through faith overcame kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> Quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong in weakness, became mighty in war, routed the armies of foreigners.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Women received their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured to death, not accepting deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And still others underwent the trial of mockings and scourgings, even, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they died by the murder of the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> (Of whom the world was not worthy), wandering over deserts and mountains and in caves and holes of the earth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise,<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect. <br><br>
