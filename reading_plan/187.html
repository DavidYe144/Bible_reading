	<p><sup><b>21</b></sup> And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And about that time no small disturbance took place concerning the Way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, afforded no little business to the craftsmen.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> These he assembled together with the workmen of similar trades as well and said, Men, you know that from this business we have our prosperity.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And you observe and hear that not only at Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and perverted a considerable number, saying that the gods being made by hands are no gods at all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And not only is there danger that our trade will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing and that the magnificence of her whom the whole of Asia and the inhabited earth worships will also be overthrown.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And when they heard this, they became full of rage and began to cry out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul’s traveling companions.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And when Paul intended to enter into the populace, the disciples would not allow him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and entreated him not to venture into the theater himself.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> So then some were crying out one thing, and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And they drew Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having pushed him forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the populace.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> But when they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the town clerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Men of Ephesus, which of you men is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the image fallen from Zeus?<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> Since these things therefore cannot be disputed, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash;<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> For you have brought forth these men who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a matter against anyone, courts are being conducted and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> But if you seek after anything further, it shall be settled in the legal assembly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> For indeed we are in danger of being charged with insurrection for today’s affair, since there is no reason for it; and with reference to it we will not be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. <br><br>
