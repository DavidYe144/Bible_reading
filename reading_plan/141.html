	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber;<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> He flees because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Others said, These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?<br><br>
