	<p>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Pursue peace with all men and sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord;<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Looking carefully lest anyone fall away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and through this many be defiled;<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For you know that also afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For you have not come forward to a mountain which could be touched and which was set on fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And to the sound of a trumpet and to the voice of words, because of which those who heard entreated that no further word be spoken to them;<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> For they could not bear that which was being commanded: “If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And so fearful was the sight, Moses said, “I am full of fear and trembling.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering;<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect;<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> See that you do not refuse Him who speaks, for if those did not escape who refused Him who warned them upon the earth, much more we shall not escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven,<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Whose voice at that time shook the earth but now has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And this word, “Yet once more,” shows clearly the removal of the things being shaken as being of things having been made, that the things which are not shaken may remain.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear;<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For our God is also a consuming fire. <br><br>
