	<h4 id="2thessalonians-1"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '../bible/53-2thessalonians.html')">2 Thessalonians 1</a></h4>
	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> So that we ourselves boast in you among the churches of God concerning your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you bear,<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> A plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Since it is just with God to repay with affliction those afflicting you,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And to you who are being afflicted, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, in flaming fire,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For which also we pray always concerning you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling and may fulfill in power your every good intention for goodness and your work of faith,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. <br><br>
   </p>
</div>
<div class="bible-text">
   <h4 id="2thessalonians-2"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '../bible/53-2thessalonians.html')">2 Thessalonians 2</a></h4>
   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I said these things to you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming),<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> The coming of whom is according to Satan’s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And because of this God sends to them an operation of error that they might believe the lie,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> So that all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness might be judged.<br><br>
