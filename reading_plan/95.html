	<p><p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And He said to them, The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Do not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals; and greet no one on the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things from them, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And heal the sick who are in it and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Even the dust from your city which clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> I say to you that it will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Yet it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said to them, I was watching Satan fall like lightning out of heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> However do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in the heavens.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> In that hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well pleasing in Your sight.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And turning to the disciples, He said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> For I tell you that many prophets and kings have wanted to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.<br><br>
