	<p><sup><b>46</b></sup> Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself?<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple.<br><br>

   <h4 id="john-9"><a onclick="open_chapter('9', '43-john.html')">John 9</a></h4>
   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came away seeing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.<br><br>
