	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish.<br><br>
