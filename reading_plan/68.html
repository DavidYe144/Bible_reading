	<p>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled, because it is written, “I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> But Peter said to Him, Even if all will be stumbled, yet I will not!<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today in this night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> But he went on speaking more intensely, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You! And they all said similarly.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> And they came to a place named Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> And He took Peter and James and John with Him and began to be awestruck and deeply distressed.<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> And going forward a little, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> And He said, Abba Father, all things are possible to You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> And He came and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to watch for one hour?<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> Watch and pray that you may not come into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> And going away again, He prayed, saying the same thing.<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> And He came the third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough. The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one betraying Me has drawn near.<br><br>
