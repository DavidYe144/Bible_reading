	<p><sup><b>27</b></sup> But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And about eight days after these words, He took with Him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And as He prayed, the appearance of His face became different, and His garment dazzling white.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Now Peter and those with him had been overcome with sleep, but when they had fully woken up, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah — not knowing what he was saying.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And while he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they became frightened as they entered into the cloud.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Chosen One. Hear Him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and reported to no one in those days anything of what they had seen.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg You to look upon my son, for he is my only child.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming; and it hardly goes away from him, all the time crushing him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And just as he was coming to Him, the demon threw him down and greatly convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and gave him back to his father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And all were astounded at the majesty of God.        And while all were marveling at all the things which He did, He said to His disciples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> Put these words into your ears; for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this saying.<br><br>
