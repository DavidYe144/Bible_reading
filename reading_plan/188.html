	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And after the uproar had ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and having exhorted them, took leave of them and went off to go into Macedonia.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And when he had passed through those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And spent three months there. And when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he resolved to return through Macedonia.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him, as well as Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and in five days came to them in Troas, where we spent seven days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread, Paul conversed with them since he was to go forth on the next day; and he extended his message until midnight.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And there were a considerable number of lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window and began to sink into deep sleep while Paul conversed longer; and when he had been overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But Paul went down and fell upon him, and embracing him, he said, Do not make a commotion, for his soul is in him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And when he had gone up and broken the bread and eaten and had spoken for a considerable time, until daybreak, he therefore went forth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And they brought the boy alive and were comforted, and that not moderately.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But we, going ahead onto the ship, set sail for Assos, from there intending to pick up Paul, for so he had arranged it, himself intending to go by foot.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And when he met us in Assos, we picked him up and came to Mitylene.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And sailing away from there, on the following day we arrived opposite Chios; and on the next day we put in at Samos. And on the day following we came to Miletus,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying so that if possible he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.<br><br>
