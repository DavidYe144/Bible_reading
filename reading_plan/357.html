	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> That the leaders took the lead in Israel, / That the people have willingly offered themselves, / Bless Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes! / I will sing; I, to Jehovah. / I will sing praise to Jehovah / The God of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> O Jehovah, when You went forth from Seir, / When You marched from the field of Edom, / The earth trembled, the heavens also dripped, / Indeed the clouds dripped water.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> The mountains quaked at the presence of Jehovah, / Sinai there, at the presence of Jehovah the God of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, / In the days of Jael, the highways were not used; / And travelers went / On the roundabout paths.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> The villages ceased <i>to act;</i> / They ceased in Israel; / Until I, Deborah, rose up; / Until I rose up <i>as</i> a mother in Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> They chose new gods; / Then there was war in their gates. / Was a shield or a spear seen / Among forty thousand in Israel?<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> My heart is with the commanders of Israel, / Those who offered themselves willingly among the people. / Bless Jehovah!<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Tell <i>of it,</i> you who ride on white donkeys, / You who sit on rich carpets, / And you who go upon the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> <i>Louder</i> than the voice of those who distribute <i>water</i> among the watering places, / There they recount the righteous deeds of Jehovah, / His righteous acts toward His villages in Israel. / Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Awake! Awake, Deborah! / Awake! Awake, speak forth a song! / Arise, Barak; / And lead captive your captives, son of Abinoam.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then a remnant of the nobles went down; / The people of Jehovah went down with me against the mighty:<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> From Ephraim, those who took root in Amalek; / Following you, Benjamin, with your peoples; / From Machir commanders came down, / And from Zebulun those who wielded the staff of him who marshals.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; / And Issachar was true to Barak; / Into the valley they were sent behind him. / Among the divisions of Reuben / There were great resolutions in heart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Why did you sit among the sheepfolds / Listening to the pipings for the flocks? / In the divisions of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Gilead stayed across the Jordan. / And as for Dan, why did he remain with the ships? / Asher sat at the shore of the sea / And stayed at his landings.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Zebulun was a people that despised their own lives <i>even</i> unto death; / And Naphtali, on the heights of the field.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> The kings came; they fought. / At that time the kings of Canaan fought / In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; / They took no gain of silver.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> From heaven the stars fought; / From their courses they fought with Sisera.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> The river Kishon swept them away, / The ancient river, the river Kishon. / March on, O my soul, with strength!<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> At that time the horse hooves stamped / With the prancing, the prancing of their mighty steeds.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Curse Meroz, says the Angel of Jehovah; / Bitterly curse its inhabitants. / For they did not come to the aid of Jehovah, / To the aid of Jehovah against the mighty.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Blessed among women shall Jael be, / The wife of Heber the Kenite; / Blessed among the women in the tent shall she be.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> He asked for water; she gave him milk. / In a bowl for nobles she presented him with cream.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> She put her hand to the tent peg, / And her right hand to the workman’s hammer; / Then she struck Sisera; she smashed his head; / Indeed she shattered and pierced his temples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> At her feet he bowed; he fell; he lay down. / At her feet he bowed; he fell. / Where he bowed, there he fell, destroyed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Through the window one looks forth and cries shrilly; / The mother of Sisera, through the lattice: / Why is his chariot so long in coming? / Why do the tracks of his chariots delay?<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> The wisest of her ladies answer her, / And she herself returns an answer to herself:<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Have they not found and divided the spoil? / A girl, two girls, to each mighty man. / The spoil of dyed garments to Sisera, / The spoil of embroidered, dyed garments; / A dyed embroidery, two embroideries, / For the neck of the spoiler.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> May all Your enemies so perish, O Jehovah. / But may those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might. And the land had rest forty years.<br><br>
