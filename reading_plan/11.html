	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> These twelve Jesus sent forth, charging them, saying, Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Do not acquire for yourselves gold nor silver nor copper for your belts;<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> No bag for the journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And as you enter into the house, greet it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.<br><br></p>
