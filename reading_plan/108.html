	<p>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man’s table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father —<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> For I have five brothers — so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone risen from the dead would go to them, they will repent.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead. <br><br>

	<h4 id="luke-17"><a onclick="open_chapter('17', '../bible/42-luke.html')">Luke 17</a></h4>
	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He said to His disciples, It is impossible for causes of stumbling not to come, but woe to him through whom they come.<br><br>
			<sup><b>2</b></sup> It is more profitable for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is hurled into the sea than to stumble one of these little ones.<br><br>
			<sup><b>3</b></sup> Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.<br><br>
			<sup><b>4</b></sup> And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.<br><br>
			<sup><b>5</b></sup> And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.<br><br>
			<sup><b>6</b></sup> But the Lord said, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you.<br><br>
			<sup><b>7</b></sup> But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table?<br><br>
			<sup><b>8</b></sup> Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?<br><br>
			<sup><b>9</b></sup> He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?<br><br>
			<sup><b>10</b></sup> So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.<br><br>
