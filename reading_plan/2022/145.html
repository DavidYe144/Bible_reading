  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And again she gave birth, to his brother Abel. And Abel was a tender of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And in the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Abel also brought <i>an</i> <i>offering,</i> from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. And Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> If you do well, will not <i>your countenance</i> be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and his desire is for you, but you must rule over him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Now You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah put a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him would not strike him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and <i>raise</i> cattle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Lamech said to his wives, / Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; / O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; / For I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> If Cain is avenged sevenfold, / Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Adam knew his wife again. And she gave birth to a son and called his name Seth, for, <i>she said,</i> God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time <i>men</i> began to call upon the name of Jehovah.<br><br>
