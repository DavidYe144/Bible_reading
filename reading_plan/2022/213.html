  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> If the thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him —<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> If the sun has risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him — <i>the thief</i> shall indeed make restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> If what he has stolen is actually found alive in his possession, whether an ox or a donkey or a sheep, he shall restore double.<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> If a man lets a field or vineyard be grazed, that is, he lets his animal loose, and it grazes in another man’s field; from the best of his own field and from the best of his own vineyard he shall make restitution.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> If fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or <i>what is growing in</i> the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall surely make restitution.<br><br>
	<sup><b>7</b></sup> If a man gives to his neighbor silver or goods to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he shall restore double.<br><br>
	<sup><b>8</b></sup> If the thief is not found, then the owner of the house shall come near to God <i>to determine</i> whether or not he laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods.<br><br>
	<sup><b>9</b></sup> For every case of transgression, <i>whether</i> concerning an ox, concerning a donkey, concerning a sheep, concerning clothing, <i>or</i> concerning any lost item about which one says, This is it, the case of both parties shall come before God; he whom God declares guilty shall restore double to his neighbor.<br><br>
	<sup><b>10</b></sup> If a man gives to his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured or driven away, with no man seeing <i>it;</i><br><br>
	<sup><b>11</b></sup> The oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, that he has not laid his hand on his neighbor’s goods; and its owner shall accept <i>it,</i> and he shall not make restitution.<br><br>
	<sup><b>12</b></sup> But if it was certainly stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner.<br><br>
	<sup><b>13</b></sup> If it was torn in pieces, let him bring it as evidence; he shall not make restitution for that which was torn.<br><br>
	<sup><b>14</b></sup> And if a man borrows <i>anything</i> from his neighbor, and it is injured or dies while its owner is not with it, he shall make full restitution.<br><br>
	<sup><b>15</b></sup> If its owner was with it, he shall not make restitution; if it was hired, only the hiring fee is due.<br><br>
	<sup><b>16</b></sup> And if a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to become his wife.<br><br>
	<sup><b>17</b></sup> If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay silver according to the dowry of virgins.<br><br>
	<sup><b>18</b></sup> You shall not allow a sorceress to live.<br><br>
	<sup><b>19</b></sup> Whoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.<br><br>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> He who sacrifices to any god, except to Jehovah only, shall be devoted to destruction.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> And you shall not wrong a sojourner, nor shall you oppress him; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> You shall not afflict any widow or orphan.<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> If you afflict them at all <i>and</i> if they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry;<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> And My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children orphans.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> If you lend silver to My people, to the poor among you, you shall not be to him as a creditor; you shall not charge him interest.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> If you ever take your neighbor’s garment as a pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down.<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> For that is his only covering; it is his garment for his skin. On what shall he lie down? And when he cries to Me I will hear, for I am gracious.<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> You shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> You shall not delay to offer the fullness of your <i>harvest</i> and of the outflow of your <i>presses.</i> The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me.<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> You shall do the same with your oxen <i>and</i> with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> And you shall be holy men to Me. And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn <i>by beasts</i> in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.<br><br>
