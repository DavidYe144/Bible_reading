  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Are they not from this, from your pleasures that war in your members?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> You lust and do not have; you murder and are jealous and are not able to obtain; you fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs unto envy?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, “God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-souled!<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Endure misery and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> One is Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and destroy. But who are you who judge your neighbor?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit;<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Whereas you do not know the matter of tomorrow, what your life will be; for you are a vapor, which appears for a little while and then disappears.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Instead you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin. <br><br>
