  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now after these things Joseph was told, Your father is sick. So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And someone told Jacob and said, Your son Joseph is coming to you. So Israel strengthened himself and sat up on his bed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jacob said to Joseph, The All-sufficient God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And He said to me, Behold, I am going to make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And your offspring whom you beget after them will be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died to my sorrow in the land of Canaan on the way, while there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, Who are these?<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given to me here. And he said, Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see your face, and now God has let me see your seed also.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and bowed himself with his face to the ground.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid <i>it</i> upon Ephraim’s head — although he was the younger — and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands with insight, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And he blessed Joseph and said, / The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, / The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; / And may my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; / And may they be a teeming multitude in the midst of the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head onto Manasseh’s head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he blessed them that day, saying,By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, / God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.Thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Israel said to Joseph, Now I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Moreover I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.<br><br>
