  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus;<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Suffer evil with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And also if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> The laboring farmer must be the first to partake of the fruit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> In which I suffer evil unto bonds as a criminal; but the word of God is not bound.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Faithful is the word: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us;<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before God not to have contentions of words, which is useful for nothing, to the ruin of those who hear.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And their word will spread like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> But foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind refuse, knowing that they beget contentions.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> But a slave of the Lord ought not to contend but be gentle toward all, apt to teach, bearing with wrong;<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth,<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And they may return to soberness out of the snare of the devil, having been caught alive by him, unto His will. <br><br>
