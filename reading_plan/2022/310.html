	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Observe the month of Abib, and hold the Passover to Jehovah your God; for in the month of Abib Jehovah your God brought you out of Egypt by night.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And you shall sacrifice the passover to Jehovah your God, from the flock and from the herd, in the place where Jehovah will choose to cause His name to dwell.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> You shall not eat anything leavened with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, <i>that is,</i> the bread of affliction (for in alarmed haste you came out of the land of Egypt); in order that you may remember the day of your coming out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And leaven shall not be seen with you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the flesh which you sacrifice in the evening on the first day remain until morning.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> You may not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which Jehovah your God is giving you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Rather, in the place where Jehovah your God will choose to cause His name to dwell, you shall sacrifice the passover in the evening, as the sun sets, at the time that you came out of Egypt.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And you shall cook and eat <i>it</i> in the place which Jehovah your God will choose, and you shall turn in the morning and go to your tents.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Six days you shall eat unleavened bread. And on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> You shall count off for yourself seven weeks. You shall begin to count the seven weeks from <i>the time that you</i> begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall hold the Feast of Weeks to Jehovah your God according to the sufficiency of the freewill offering of your hand, which you will give, as Jehovah your God blesses you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And you and your son and daughter, and your male servant and female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates and the sojourner and the orphan and the widow who are in your midst shall rejoice before Jehovah your God in the place where Jehovah your God will choose to cause His name to dwell.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall keep and do these statutes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> You shall hold the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after your ingathering from your threshing floor and your winepress.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And you and your son and daughter, and your male servant and female servant, and the Levite and the sojourner and the orphan and the widow who are within your gates shall rejoice in your feast.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> You shall keep the feast to Jehovah your God for seven days in the place which Jehovah will choose, for Jehovah your God will bless you in all your produce and in all your undertakings; therefore you shall be nothing but joyful.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Three times a year all your males shall appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He will choose: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Tabernacles. And they shall not appear before Jehovah empty-handed;<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Each man <i>shall give</i> as he is able to give, according to the blessing of Jehovah your God, which He has given you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> You shall appoint for yourself judges and officers in all your cities which Jehovah your God is giving you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> You shall not distort justice; you shall not respect persons, nor shall you take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Righteousness, <i>and only</i> righteousness, shall you pursue, in order that you may live and possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Jehovah your God, which you will make for yourself;<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Nor shall you erect for yourself a pillar, <i>something</i> which Jehovah your God hates.<br><br>
