  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting;<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and around the throne, there were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And when the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> The twenty-four elders will fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created. <br><br>
