		<sup><b>52</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> You shall increase the larger <i>group’s</i> inheritance, and you shall reduce the smaller <i>group’s</i> inheritance. Each shall be given their inheritance according to those who were numbered of them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> But the land shall be apportioned by lot; they shall inherit <i>it</i> according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> According to the lot their inheritance shall be apportioned among the larger and the smaller <i>groups.</i><br><br>

		<sup><b>61</b></sup> And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>62</b></sup> And those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward, for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because no inheritance was given to them among the children of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>63</b></sup> These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.<br><br>
		<sup><b>64</b></sup> But among these there was not one of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who had numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.<br><br>
