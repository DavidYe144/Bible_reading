  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> This month will be the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first of the months of the year to you.<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> Speak to all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month each man shall take a lamb according to his fathers’ house, a lamb for a household.<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take <i>one</i> according to the number of the persons <i>in the houses;</i> according to each man’s eating you shall make your count for the lamb.<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take <i>it</i> from the sheep or from the goats.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it at twilight.<br><br>
	<sup><b>7</b></sup> And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>8</b></sup> And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread with bitter herbs.<br><br>
	<sup><b>9</b></sup> Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire — its head with its legs and with its inward parts.<br><br>
	<sup><b>10</b></sup> And you shall not let any of it remain until the morning, but any of it that remains until the morning you shall burn with fire.<br><br>
	<sup><b>11</b></sup> And this is how you shall eat it: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is Jehovah’s passover.<br><br>
	<sup><b>12</b></sup> For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. Also against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Jehovah.<br><br>
	<sup><b>13</b></sup> And the blood shall be a sign for you upon the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there will be no plague upon you to destroy <i>you</i> when I strike the land of Egypt.<br><br>
	<sup><b>14</b></sup> And this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations as a perpetual statute you shall keep it as a feast.<br><br>
	<sup><b>15</b></sup> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.<br><br>
	<sup><b>16</b></sup> And on the first day you shall have a holy convocation, and on the seventh day a holy convocation. No work at all shall be done on them, except <i>to prepare</i> what every person will eat; that alone may be done by you.<br><br>
	<sup><b>17</b></sup> And you shall keep the <i>Feast of</i> Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall keep this day throughout your generations as a perpetual statute.<br><br>
	<sup><b>18</b></sup> In the first <i>month,</i> on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.<br><br>
	<sup><b>19</b></sup> For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses. For whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel, whether a sojourner or a native of the land.<br><br>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, Draw out and take lambs according to your families, and slaughter the passover.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip <i>it</i> in the blood that is in the basin, and you shall apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and to the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the entrance of his house until the morning.<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood upon the lintel and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will pass over the entrance and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to smite <i>you.</i><br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> And you shall observe this matter as a statute for you and for your sons in perpetuity.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> And when you come to the land which Jehovah will give you, as He has promised, you shall observe this service.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> And when your children say to you, What do you mean by this service?<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> You shall say, It is the passover sacrifice to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses. And the people bowed and worshipped.<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> And the children of Israel went and did <i>so;</i> just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> And at midnight Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> And Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house where there was not someone dead.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> And he called for Moses and Aaron in the night and said, Rise up, go out from the midst of my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as you have said.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said; and go and bless me also.<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> And the Egyptians urged the people on, so as to hasten their departure out of the land, for they said, All of us will be dead.<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> And a mixed multitude went up also with them, as well as flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it had not been leavened because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay; nor had they prepared for themselves any provisions.<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> Now the time of the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred thirty years.<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> And at the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> It was for Jehovah a night of watching, to bring them out from the land of Egypt. That same night is a night of watching to Jehovah for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.<br><br>
	<sup><b>43</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the passover: No foreigner shall eat of it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>44</b></sup> However, any man’s servant who is bought with money, when you have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>45</b></sup> A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>46</b></sup> It shall be eaten in one house. You shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones.<br><br>
	<sup><b>47</b></sup> All the assembly of Israel shall keep it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>48</b></sup> But if a stranger sojourns with you and will observe the Passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to observe it; and he will be like one who is a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>49</b></sup> One law shall be for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.<br><br>
	<sup><b>50</b></sup> And all the children of Israel did <i>so;</i> just as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.<br><br>
	<sup><b>51</b></sup> And on that very day Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.<br><br>
