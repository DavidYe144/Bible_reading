  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian female servant, whose name was Hagar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Sarai said to Abram, Because Jehovah has prevented me from bearing, please go in to my female servant; perhaps I will have children through her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> So after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her female servant, and gave her to Abram her husband to be a wife.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Sarai said to Abram, May the wrong <i>done</i> to me be upon you. I gave my female servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May Jehovah judge between me and you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Abram said to Sarai, Your female servant is now in your hand; do to her what is good in your eyes. So Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from before her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And He said, Hagar, Sarai’s female servant, where did you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am fleeing from before my mistress Sarai.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, I will greatly multiply your seed, so that it will not be counted for multitude.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her,You have now conceived / And will bear a son, / And you shall call his name Ishmael, / Because Jehovah has heard of your affliction.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And he will be a wild ass of a man; / His hand will be against everyone, / And everyone’s hand, against him; / And he will settle down opposite all his brothers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, You are a God who reveals Himself, for she said, Do I even remain here after He has revealed Himself to me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; there it is, between Kadesh and Bered.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.<br><br>
