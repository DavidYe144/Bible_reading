	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the children of Israel journeyed and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And Moab was very afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Moab said to the elders of Midian, This multitude will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. Now Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, There is a people here who have come out from Egypt; now they cover the surface of the land and have settled over against me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Now, therefore, please come; curse this people for me, since they are mightier than I. Perhaps I may be able to strike them and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with fees for divination in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And he said to them, Spend tonight here, and I will bring back word to you as Jehovah speaks to me. And the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, has sent <i>word</i> to me, <i>saying,</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> There is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come; curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> So Balaam rose up in the morning and said to the rulers from Balak, Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And the rulers of Moab rose up and went to Balak and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> So Balak yet again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than these.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For I will indeed honor you greatly; and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore; curse this people for me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Now you therefore please stay here tonight also, so that I may know what more Jehovah might speak to me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, Since the men have come to call you, rise up; go with them, but only what I speak to you shall you do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the rulers of Moab.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And God’s anger was kindled because he was going, and the Angel of Jehovah took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Then the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pressed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he struck her again.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah went further and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam. Then Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you? And he said, No.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and he bowed his head and fell on his face.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I am here, having come out as an adversary, because your way was unrestrained before Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And the donkey saw Me and turned aside before Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, I would surely have killed you just now and let her live.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it displeases You, I will turn back.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men; but you shall speak only the word that I shall speak to you. So Balaam went with the rulers from Balak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, at the farthest point of the border.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send <i>word</i> urgently to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not indeed able to honor you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And Balaam said to Balak, Here I am; I have come to you now. Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent <i>them</i> to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and he saw from there the edge of the people.<br><br>
