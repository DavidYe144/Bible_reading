	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And he took up his parable and said,Balaam the son of Beor declares, / And the man whose eye is opened declares;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> He declares, he who hears the words of God, / Who sees the vision of the All-sufficient One, / Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your tabernacles, O Israel!<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Like valleys they are spread forth, / Like gardens beside a river, / Like aloes which Jehovah has planted, / Like cedars beside water.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Water shall flow from his buckets, / And his seed shall be in many waters, / And his king shall be higher than Agag, / And his kingdom shall be exalted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> God is the One who brought him forth out of Egypt; / He has as it were the horns of the wild ox. / He shall eat up the nations, his adversaries, / And shall break their bones in pieces, / And shatter <i>them</i> with his arrows.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> He couches; he lies down like a lion / And like a lioness; who will rouse him up? / Blessed is everyone who blesses you, / And cursed is everyone who curses you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed <i>them</i> these three times.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Therefore now flee to your place! I said I would greatly honor you, but now Jehovah has kept you away from honor.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad from my own heart? What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And now therefore, I am going to my people. Come, let me give you counsel as to what this people will do to your people in the last days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And he took up his parable and said,Balaam the son of Beor declares, / And the man whose eye is opened declares;<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> He declares, he who hears the words of God / And obtains the knowledge of the Most High, / Who sees the vision of the All-sufficient One, / Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> I see Him, but not now; / I behold Him, but not near. / There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob, / And a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, / And He shall crush the corners of Moab / And break down all the sons of Sheth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And Edom shall be dispossessed — / Seir, His enemies, shall also be dispossessed — / While Israel does valiantly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And One from Jacob shall have dominion / And destroy the remnant from the city.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And he looked on Amalek and took up his parable and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, / But his latter end <i>shall come</i> to destruction.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And he looked on the Kenites and took up his parable and said,Strong is your dwelling place, / And your nest is set in the rock.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Nevertheless Kain shall be burned / Until Asshur carry you away captive.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And he took up his parable and said,Alas, who shall live when God does this?<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But ships <i>shall come</i> from the coast of Kittim, / And they shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber; / And he also <i>shall come</i> to destruction.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And Balaam rose up and went back to his place, and Balak also went his way.<br><br>
