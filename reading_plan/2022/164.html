  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the life of Sarah was one hundred twenty-seven years. <i>These were</i> the years of the life of Sarah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. And Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Abraham rose up from before his dead <i>wife</i> and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> I am a stranger and a sojourner among you. Give me the possession of a burial place among you that I may bury my dead <i>wife</i> out of my sight.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God in our midst. In the choicest of our burial places bury your dead <i>wife.</i> None of us will withhold from you his burial place for burying your dead <i>wife.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Abraham rose up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your desire that I should bury my dead <i>wife</i> out of my sight, hear me, and entreat Ephron the son of Zohar for me,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> That he would give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his <i>and</i> which is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your midst for the possession of a burial place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, <i>in the hearing</i> of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave that is in it; to you I give it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you; bury your dead <i>wife.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, But if you will, please hear me; I will give the price of the field. Take <i>it</i> from me, that I may bury my dead <i>wife</i> there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> My lord, listen to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Therefore bury your dead <i>wife.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah <i>and</i> which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field, which were in all its territory, were assured<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, in the presence of all who went in at the gate of his city.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And the field and the cave that is in it were assured to Abraham for the possession of a burial place from the children of Heth.<br><br>
