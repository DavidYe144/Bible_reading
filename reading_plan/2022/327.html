			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And he said, / Jehovah came from Sinai, / And He dawned upon them from Seir; / He shined forth from Mount Paran, / And He approached from the myriads of holy ones; / From His right hand a fiery law <i>went</i> out to them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> Indeed, He loves the people. / All His saints were in Your hand, / And they sat down at Your feet; / <i>Everyone</i> receives of Your words.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> Moses commanded us a law, / A possession of the congregation of Jacob.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And He was King in Jeshurun, / When the heads of the people gathered themselves, / The tribes of Israel together.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> May Reuben live and not die, / Nor his men be few.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> And this <i>is the blessing</i> concerning Judah; and he said,Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, / And bring him to his people. / With his hands he contended for them; / And may You be a help against his adversaries.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> And concerning Levi he said,May Your Thummim and Urim be with Your faithful man, / Whom You tested at Massah, / <i>With whom</i> You contended at the waters of Meribah —<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> He who said of his father and mother, / I do not regard him; / And his brothers he did not acknowledge, / And his children he did not recognize; / For they have kept Your speaking / And have guarded Your covenant.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> They shall show Jacob Your ordinances, / And Israel Your law; / They shall put incense before Your nostrils / And whole <i>burnt</i> offerings upon Your altar.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> Bless, O Jehovah, his might, / And the work of his hands accept; / Wound thoroughly the loins of those who rise up against him / And of those who hate him, that they may not rise up <i>again.</i><br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> Concerning Benjamin he said,The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell securely beside Him; / <i>Jehovah</i> shall cover over him all the day, / And He shall dwell between his shoulders.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> And concerning Joseph he said,May his land be blessed of Jehovah / With the choicest things of heaven, with the dew / And with the deep <i>waters</i> that couch beneath;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> With the choicest of the crops of the sun, / And with the choicest of the yield of the moons;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> With the top of the ancient mountains, / And with the choicest things of the eternal hills;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> With the choicest things of the earth, and the fullness thereof, / And the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush. / May they come upon the head of Joseph, / And upon the top of the head of him who is separated among his brothers.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> <i>Like</i> his firstborn ox, he has majesty; / And his horns are the horns of the wild ox; / With them he shall drive peoples / <i>To</i> the ends of the earth together. / Those are the ten thousands of Ephraim; / And those the thousands of Manasseh.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And concerning Zebulun he said,Rejoice, Zebulun, for your going forth, / And Issachar, for your tents!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> They shall call peoples to the mountain; / There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; / For they shall suck the abundance of the seas / And the hidden treasures of the sand.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And concerning Gad he said,Blessed be He who enlarges Gad. / He dwells as a lioness, / And tears off the arm, yea, even the top of the head.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And he provided the first part for himself, / For there the portion of a lawgiver is reserved; / And he came with the heads of the people; / He executed the righteousness of Jehovah / And His judgments with Israel.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> And concerning Dan he said,Dan is a lion’s whelp / That leaps forth from Bashan.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And concerning Naphtali he said,O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, / And full of the blessing of Jehovah: / Possess the sea and the south.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And concerning Asher he said,Blessed be Asher above the sons. / May he be the one favored of his brothers, / And the one dipping his foot in oil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Your doorbolts shall be iron and copper; / And as your days are, so shall your strength be.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, / Who rides through the heavens as your help / And in His majesty through the skies.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> The God of old is <i>your</i> habitation, / And underneath are eternal arms. / And He drove out the enemy before you / And said, Destroy!<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> So Israel dwelt securely, / The fountain of Jacob in solitude, / On a land of grain and new wine; / And the heavens over him drop <i>their</i> dew.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Happy are you, O Israel; who is like you? / A people saved by Jehovah, / The shield of your help / And <i>He</i> who is the sword of your majesty! / So your enemies shall come cringing to you, / And you shall tread upon their high places.<br><br>
