	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the tribes of the children of Israel,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And they spoke to them in Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah commanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in with their pasture lands for our cattle.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> So the children of Israel gave the Levites, according to the commandment of Jehovah, these cities with their pasture lands out of their inheritance:<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And to the children of Aaron the priest who were of the Levites there went by lot thirteen cities out of the tribe of Judah and out of the tribe of the Simeonites and out of the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>

		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And they went to the children of Aaron, <i>one</i> of the families of the Kohathites, of the children of Levi; for the first lot was theirs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And they gave them Kiriath-arba (Arba <i>was</i> the father of Anak), which is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with its pasture lands around it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.<br><br>

		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And as for the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath, the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim were <i>given.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And they gave them Shechem with its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer; and Gezer with its pasture lands<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands: four cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And out of the tribe of Dan: Eltekeh with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands: four cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh: Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands: two cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> All the cities for the families of the children of Kohath who remained were ten, with their pasture lands.<br><br>

		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And out of the tribe of Asher: Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands: four cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And out of the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for the manslayer; and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands: three cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities, with their pasture lands.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, <i>they gave</i> Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands,<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Dimnah with its pasture lands, Nahalal with its pasture lands: four cities.<br><br>

		<sup><b>40</b></sup> <i>These were</i> all the cities for the children of Merari according to their families, which remained of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Each of these cities had its pasture lands around it; so it was with all these cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> So Jehovah gave Israel all the land that He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they possessed it and dwelt in it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And Jehovah gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And no one among all their enemies could stand before them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> Not a word failed of all the good things that Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.<br><br>
