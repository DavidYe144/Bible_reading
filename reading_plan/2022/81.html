  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> To slander no one, to be uncontentious, forbearing, showing all meekness toward all men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> But when the kindness and the love to man of our Savior God appeared,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit,<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Faithful is the word, and concerning these things I desire you to confidently affirm, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain respectable works. These things are good and profitable to men.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Knowing that such a one is perverted and is sinning, though he is condemned by his own self.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward diligently that nothing may be lacking to them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And let those also who are ours learn to maintain respectable works for their necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. <br><br>
