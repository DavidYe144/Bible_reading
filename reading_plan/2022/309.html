	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At the end of <i>every</i> seven years you shall issue a release.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor shall release from his hand that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact <i>it</i> from his neighbor or his brother, for Jehovah’s release has been proclaimed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> From the foreigner you may exact <i>the debt;</i> but whatever of yours your brother has, your hand shall release.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> However, there shall not be any needy among you (for Jehovah will surely bless you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess),<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> <i>But</i> only if you carefully listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and are certain to do all this commandment which I am commanding you today.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> For Jehovah your God will bless you as He has promised you. And you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> If among you there is a needy one amidst your brothers within any of your gates in your land, which Jehovah your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart and you shall not close up your hand from your needy brother;<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> But you must open your hand to him, and you must lend enough for his need in whatever he lacks.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Be careful that there is not within your heart a base thought like this: The seventh year, the year of release, is near; and your eye be evil against your needy brother and you do not give him <i>anything,</i> and he cry against you to Jehovah, and it become sin to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> You must give to him, and your heart shall not be displeased when you give to him; for on account of this matter Jehovah your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For the needy will not cease <i>being</i> in the land; therefore I am commanding you, saying, You must open your hand to your brother, to the poor one with you and to the needy one with you in your land.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> If your brother, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years; but in the seventh year you shall set him free.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And when you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed;<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> You must supply him richly from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your winepress; as Jehovah your God has blessed you, <i>so</i> shall you give to him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and <i>that</i> Jehovah your God ransomed you; therefore I am commanding you this thing today.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And if he says to you, I will not go forth from you, because he loves you and your household, for it goes well with him <i>to be</i> with you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Then you shall take an awl and run <i>it</i> through his ear and into the door, and he shall be your servant forever; and thus also shall you do to your female servant.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> You shall not view it as a hardship when you set him free; for he served you for six years, <i>saving you</i> double the wages of a hired hand, and Jehovah your God will bless you in all that you do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> All firstborn males that are brought forth in your herd and in your flock you shall sanctify to Jehovah your God; you shall not do work with your firstborn ox, nor shall you shear your firstborn sheep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> You and your household shall eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place which Jehovah will choose.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And if there is a blemish in it, lameness or blindness, any serious blemish, you shall not sacrifice it to Jehovah your God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike <i>may eat it</i> as the gazelle and the deer <i>are eaten.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> However, you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out upon the earth like water.<br><br>
