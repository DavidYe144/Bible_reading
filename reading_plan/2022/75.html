  <h4 id="2timothy-1"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '55-2timothy.html')">2 Timothy 1</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> To Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, while unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But being in Rome, he sought me out diligently and found me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in how many things he served me in Ephesus, you know best. <br><br>
