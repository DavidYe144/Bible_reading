  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, not lovers of good,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power; from these also turn away.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For of these are those who creep into houses and take captive silly women heaped with sins, who are led by various desires<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And are always learning yet never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And in the manner that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But they will not advance farther, for their folly will be completely manifest to all, as also the folly of those became.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But you have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Persecutions, sufferings, such as befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra. Such persecutions I bore, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work. <br><br>
