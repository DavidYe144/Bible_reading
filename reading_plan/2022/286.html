	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Command the children of Israel and say to them, My offering, My food for My offerings by fire of a satisfying fragrance to Me, you shall be careful to present to Me at its appointed time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And you shall say to them, This is the offering by fire which you shall present to Jehovah: two male lambs a year old without blemish each day as a continual burnt offering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with the fourth of a hin of beaten oil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> It is a continual burnt offering, which was set up on Mount Sinai for a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And its drink offering shall be the fourth of a hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; you shall offer <i>it</i> with the meal offering and its drink offering as in the morning, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and its drink offering —<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And at the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering to Jehovah: two bulls of the herd and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And three-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for each bull; and two-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And a tenth <i>of an ephah</i> of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering for each lamb for a burnt offering, a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and a third of a hin for the ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Also one male goat for a sin offering to Jehovah shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month shall be Jehovah’s Passover.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> On the first day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor;<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> But you shall present an offering by fire, a burnt offering to Jehovah: two bulls of the herd and one ram and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish for you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And you shall offer their meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil: three-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> for a bull and two-tenths for a ram;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> You shall offer one-tenth for each lamb of the seven lambs;<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And one male goat as a sin offering, to make expiation for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> In this way you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Also in the day of the firstfruits, when you present a new meal offering to Jehovah in your <i>Feast of</i> Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no work of labor;<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> But you shall present a burnt offering for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah: two bulls of the herd, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And their meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil: three-tenths <i>of an ephah</i> for each bull, two-tenths for one ram,<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> One-tenth for each lamb of the seven lambs;<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> <i>And</i> one male goat, to make expiation for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Besides the continual burnt offering and its meal offering, you shall offer them (they shall be without blemish for you) and their drink offerings.<br><br>
