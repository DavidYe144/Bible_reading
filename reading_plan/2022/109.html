  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> (And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us);<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And these things we write that our joy may be made full.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth;<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us. <br><br>
