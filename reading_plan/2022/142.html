  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, <i>and</i> fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with their seed in them according to their kind; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb that produces seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit that produces seed; they shall be for you as food.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And to every animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven and to everything that creeps upon the earth, in which is a living soul, <i>I have given</i> every green herb for food; and it was so.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.<br><br>
