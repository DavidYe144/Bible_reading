  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And they journeyed from Elim, and all the assembly of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> And the children of Israel said to them, If only we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole congregation with hunger.<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Moses, I will now rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My law.<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> And on the sixth day when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> So Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In the evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt;<br><br>
	<sup><b>7</b></sup> And in the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah, for He hears your murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we, that you murmur against us?<br><br>
	<sup><b>8</b></sup> And Moses said, <i>This you will see</i> when Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to the full in the morning, for Jehovah hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against Jehovah.<br><br>
	<sup><b>9</b></sup> And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your murmurings.<br><br>
	<sup><b>10</b></sup> And as Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and there the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.<br><br>
	<sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
	<sup><b>12</b></sup> I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At twilight you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>13</b></sup> And at evening quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.<br><br>
	<sup><b>14</b></sup> And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes, fine as the frost on the earth.<br><br>
	<sup><b>15</b></sup> And when the children of Israel saw <i>it,</i> they said to one another, What is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.<br><br>
	<sup><b>16</b></sup> This is what Jehovah has commanded, Gather of it, each one according to his eating; you shall take an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, each one for those who are in his tent.<br><br>
	<sup><b>17</b></sup> And the children of Israel did so; and <i>some</i> gathered much, and <i>some</i> little.<br><br>
	<sup><b>18</b></sup> And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack; each of them gathered according to his eating.<br><br>
	<sup><b>19</b></sup> And Moses said to them, Let no man leave any of it until the morning.<br><br>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> But they did not listen to Moses, and some men left part of it until the morning; and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was indignant with them.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> And they gathered it morning by morning, each one according to his eating; and when the sun became hot, it melted.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the leaders of the assembly came and told Moses.<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has spoken, Tomorrow is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to Jehovah. Bake what you will bake, and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over put aside for yourselves to be kept until the morning.<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor was there any worm in it.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> And Moses said, Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath; on it there will be none.<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> See, Jehovah has given you the Sabbath, therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Let each of you stay in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> So the people rested on the seventh day.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> And the house of Israel called its name manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony to be kept.<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to inhabitable land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.<br><br>
