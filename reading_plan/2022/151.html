  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Rodanim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> From these the islands and coastal regions of the nations were separated into their lands, every one according to his tongue, according to their families, in their nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Cush begot Nimrod: He began to be a mighty one on the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is said, Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Akkad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> From that land he went into Assyria and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-ir and Calah<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Resen between Nineveh and Calah, that is, the great city.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Mizraim begot the Ludim and the Anamim and the Lehabim and the Naphtuhim<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the Pathrusim and the Casluhim, from which came the Philistines, and the Caphtorim.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn and Heth<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the Jebusites and the Amorites and the Girgashites<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And the Hivites and the Arkites and the Sinites<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the Arvadites and the Zemarites and the Hamathites, and afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread out.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the territory of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza, <i>and</i> as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, children were born.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> The sons of Shem: Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the sons of Aram: Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Arpachshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And to Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Joktan begot Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Obal and Abimael and Sheba<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the hill country of the east.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.<br><br>
