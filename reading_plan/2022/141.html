  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I am about to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me; and suddenly the Lord, whom you seek, will come to His temple. And the Angel of the covenant, whom you desire, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And who will endure the day of His coming? And who will stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, and they will offer to Jehovah a sacrifice in righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And the sacrifice of Judah and of Jerusalem will be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old and as in the former years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely and against those who oppress the hired worker for his hire, <i>and</i> the widow and the orphan, and those who turn the stranger aside, and who do not fear Me, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For I, Jehovah, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept <i>them.</i> Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts. But you say, How shall we return?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> With the curse you are cursed, yet you, <i>even</i> the whole nation, rob Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, and for your sake he will not destroy the fruit of the ground; and for your sake the vine will not lose its fruit in the field, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Your words have been strongly against Me, says Jehovah; but you say, What have we spoken against You?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> You say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge and have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And now we call the arrogant blessed; not only have those who act wickedly been built up, but they also try God and escape.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Then those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another, each with his neighbor. And Jehovah gave heed and listened, and a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who feared Jehovah and considered His name.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they will be Mine, says Jehovah of hosts, a personal treasure, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them, as a man spares his son who serves him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And you will return and discern between him who is righteous and him who is wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.<br><br>

  <h4 id="malachi-4"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '39-malachi.html')">Malachi 4</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For indeed the day comes, burning like a furnace, and all the proud ones and all the ones who act wickedly will be stubble; and the coming day will set them ablaze, says Jehovah of hosts, so that it will not leave them root or branch.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But unto you who fear My name will the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings, and you will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, says Jehovah of hosts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Remember the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, <i>that is,</i> the statutes and the ordinances.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> I am about to send Elijah the prophet to you before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a curse.<br><br>
