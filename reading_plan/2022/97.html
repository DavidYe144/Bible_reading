  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For if there comes into your synagogue a man with gold rings in splendid clothing, and there also comes in a poor man in filthy clothing,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And you look upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, You sit here in a good place, and to the poor man you say, You stand there, or sit under my footstool;<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil reasonings?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and is it not they who drag you to the courts?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> You see that faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”; and he was called the friend of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out by a different way?<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. <br><br>
