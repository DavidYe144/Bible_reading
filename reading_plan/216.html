	<p><sup><b>19</b></sup> You will say to me then, Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will?<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles?<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> As He also says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not My people My people, and her who was not beloved beloved;<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved;<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> For the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, accomplishing it and cutting it short.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And as Isaiah has previously said, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have laid hold of righteousness, but a righteousness which is out of faith;<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to that law.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Why? Because they pursued it not out of faith, but as it were out of works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling,<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> As it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense, and he who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.” <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Brothers, the good pleasure of my heart and my petition to God for them is for their salvation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to full knowledge;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> For because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.<br><br>
