	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He told them a parable to the end that they ought always to pray and not lose heart,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not regard man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And for a time he would not; but afterward he said within himself, Even though I do not fear God nor regard man,<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, lest by continually coming she wear me out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them?<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And He told this parable also to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised the rest:<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men — extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And they were bringing to Him also their babies that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> But Jesus called them to Him, saying, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.<br><br>
