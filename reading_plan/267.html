	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the Gentiles —<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church,<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Therefore I ask you not to faint at my afflictions for your sake, since they are your glory.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man,<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen. <br><br>
