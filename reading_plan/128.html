	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> (Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples),<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And He had to pass through Samaria.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again,<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband,<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am He.<br><br>
