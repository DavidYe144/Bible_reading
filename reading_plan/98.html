	<p><p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And while He was in a certain place praying, when He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Give us each day our daily bread.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us into temptation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And He said to them, Who among you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Since a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him;<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And that one, from inside, will answer and say, Do not trouble me; the door is already shut and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything?<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> I say to you, Even though he will not rise up and give him anything because he is his friend, surely because of his shameless persistence he will rise and give him what he needs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> But what father among you whose son shall ask for a fish will instead of a fish hand him a snake?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Or if he shall also ask for an egg will hand him a scorpion?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And once He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke, and the crowds marveled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> But some of them said, By Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, He casts out the demons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And others, tempting Him, sought from Him a sign out of heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I cast out the demons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> But if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But if I by the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own homestead, his possessions are in peace.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away his whole armor in which he had trusted and distributes his spoil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and not finding it, it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And it comes and finds it swept and decorated.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Then it goes and takes along other spirits more evil than itself, seven of them, and they enter and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And as He said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd lifted up her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But He said, Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And as the crowds were thronging together, He began to say, This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.<br><br>
