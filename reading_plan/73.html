	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Inasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning the matters which have been fully accomplished among us,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Even as those who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> It seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the first, to write them out for you in an orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> So that you may fully know the certainty of the things concerning which you were instructed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And while he served as priest in the order of his course before God,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> According to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And Zachariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And you will have joy and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by no means drink wine and liquor. And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And many of the sons of Israel he will turn to the Lord their God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And it is he who will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the prudence of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce the good news of these things to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And when he came out, he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went to his house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and stayed in seclusion for five months, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> In this way has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which He looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.<br><br>
