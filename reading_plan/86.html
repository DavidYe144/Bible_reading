	<p>				 
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And He lifted up His eyes to His disciples and said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Blessed are those who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are those who weep now, for you shall laugh.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Blessed are you when men hate you and when they separate you from them and reproach you and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation in full.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Woe to you who are satiated now, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> But to you who hear I say, Love your enemies; do well to those who hate you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> To him who beats you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> To everyone who asks of you, give; and from him who takes away your things, do not require their return.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And just as you want men to do to you, do to them likewise.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And if you love those who love you, what thanks is it to you? For even sinners love those who love them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> For if you also do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners do the same.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners lend to sinners that they may get back the equal amount.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> But love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the unthankful and evil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> Be full of compassion, even as your Father also is full of compassion.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And do not judge, and you shall by no means be judged; and do not condemn, and you shall by no means be condemned; release, and you will be released;<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And He also spoke a parable to them: A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will not both fall into a pit?<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who has been perfected will be like his teacher.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam which is in your own eye you do not consider?<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the splinter which is in your eye, you yourself not seeing the beam which is in your eye? Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter which is in your brother’s eye.<br><br>
