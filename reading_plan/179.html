  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched <i>his tent</i> near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And yet again she bore a son and called his name Shelah, and she was in Chezib when she bore him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah put him to death.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up seed to your brother.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> But since Onan knew that the seed would not be his, whenever he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled <i>it</i> on the ground, so that he would not give seed to his brother.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But what he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, so He put him to death also.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up. For he thought, He also may die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And it was told to Tamar, saying, Your father-in-law is now going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And she removed from herself her widow’s garments and covered <i>herself</i> with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as <i>his</i> wife.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And when Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And he turned aside to her by the way and said, Come now, let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And he said, I will send <i>you</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Only if you give me a pledge until you send <i>it.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave <i>them</i> to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And she arose and went away, and removed her veil from herself and put on her widow’s garments.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he did not find her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute who was by the road at Enaim? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And he returned to Judah and said, I did not find her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Judah said, Let her keep <i>the things</i> for herself, lest we become a laughing stock; you see, I sent <i>her</i> this kid, but you did not find her.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And about three months later it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; moreover, now she is pregnant by harlotry. And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> As she was being brought out, she sent <i>word</i> to her father-in-law, saying, I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong. And she said, Please note whose these are, the seal and the cords and the staff.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Judah took note <i>of them</i> and said, She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he did not know her again anymore.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> And at the time of her delivery, there were twins in her womb.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And while she was giving birth, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This one came out first.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> But when he drew back his hand, his brother suddenly came out; and she said, What a breach you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and his name was called Zerah.<br><br>
