			<p>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But you did not so learn Christ,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> Therefore having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> Neither give place to the devil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> He who steals should steal no more, but rather should labor, working with his own hands in that which is respectable, that he may have something to share with him who has need.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking be removed from you, with all malice.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ also forgave you. <br><br>

			<h4 id="ephesians-5"><a onclick="open_chapter('5', '../bible/49-ephesians.html')">Ephesians 5</a></h4>
			<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>2</b></sup> And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>3</b></sup> But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>4</b></sup> And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>5</b></sup> For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>6</b></sup> Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore do not be partakers with them;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>8</b></sup> For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light<br><br>
				 <sup><b>9</b></sup> (For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),<br><br>
				 <sup><b>10</b></sup> Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>11</b></sup> And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>12</b></sup> For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father,<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ:<br><br>
