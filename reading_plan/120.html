	<p>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Said to them, You have brought this man to me as one who turns the people away, and behold, I have examined Him before you and found no fault in this man regarding the accusations you bring against Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> No, neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Now he was obliged to release to them one prisoner at the feast.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> But they cried out all together, saying, Take this man away and release to us Barabbas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> He was one who, for a certain insurrection that occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into the prison.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But they continued to shout, saying, Crucify, crucify Him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in Him; I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> But they pressed him with loud voices, asking that He be crucified, and their voices prevailed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And Pilate gave sentence that their request be carried out,<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And as they led Him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the country, and they placed the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which have not nourished.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> For if they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And two others also, who were criminals, were led with Him to be executed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast lots.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the people stood by, looking on. And the rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar,<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And one of the criminals who were hanged there blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing amiss.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.<br><br>
