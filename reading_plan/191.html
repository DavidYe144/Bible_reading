	<p><sup><b>22</b></sup> What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore do this that we tell you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have already written, having decided that they should keep themselves from idol sacrifices and blood and anything strangled and fornication.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Then Paul took the men and on the following day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And when the seven days were about to be concluded, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and threw all the crowd into confusion; and they laid their hands on him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; and further, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has profaned this holy place.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him outside the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And he at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Then the commander drew near and laid hold of him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. And he inquired who he might be and what he had done.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And some among the crowd were shouting one thing, and some another. And since he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And when Paul came to the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> For the multitude of the people were following and crying out, Away with him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And when he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, Am I allowed to say anything to you? And he said, You know Greek?<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> You are not then the Egyptian who some days ago revolted and led out the four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> But Paul said, I am a Jewish man of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city, and I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying, <br><br>
