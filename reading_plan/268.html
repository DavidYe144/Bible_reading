	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace:<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> One Lord, one faith, one baptism;<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> (Now this, “He ascended,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.)<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.<br><br>
