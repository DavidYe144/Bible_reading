	<p>				 
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called Euraquilo.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get control of the small boat.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And when they had hoisted it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. And because they feared that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> The next day, as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard, even with their own hands.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and while no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope that we might be saved was being abandoned.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And when they had been a long time without food, Paul then stood in their midst and said, O men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and gained this damage and loss.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Therefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> But we must run aground on a certain island.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they sounded again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And all became cheerful, and they also took food.<br><br>
