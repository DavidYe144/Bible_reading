	<p><sup><b>22</b></sup> And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> (Even as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> He received Him into his arms and blessed God and said,<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace;<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> For my eyes have seen Your salvation,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And His father and mother marveled at the things being spoken about Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in Israel and for a sign spoken against —<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And a sword will pierce through your own soul also — so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And she was a widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and petitions night and day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And at that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.<br><br>
