				<p>
				<sup><b>12</b></sup> But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>13</b></sup> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>15</b></sup> And also we are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified concerning God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if indeed the dead are not raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>16</b></sup> For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>17</b></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>19</b></sup> If it is only that we have hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>20</b></sup> But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>21</b></sup> For since through man came death, through man also came the resurrection of the dead.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>22</b></sup> For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>23</b></sup> But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ’s at His coming;<br><br>
				 <sup><b>24</b></sup> Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>25</b></sup> For He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>26</b></sup> Death, the last enemy, is being abolished.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>27</b></sup> For He has subjected all things under His feet. But when He says that all things are subjected, it is evident that all things are except Him who has subjected all things to Him.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>28</b></sup> And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>29</b></sup> Otherwise what shall they who are baptized for the dead do? If the dead are actually not raised, why then are they baptized for them?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>30</b></sup> Why also do we brave danger every hour?<br><br>
				 <sup><b>31</b></sup> I protest by the boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>32</b></sup> If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>33</b></sup> Do not be deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.<br><br>
				 <sup><b>34</b></sup> Awake from the drunken stupor righteously and do not sin, for some of you are ignorant of God. I speak to your shame.<br><br>
