  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him, as also Moses was in all His house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later;<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you hear His voice,<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Where your fathers tried Me by testing Me and saw My works for forty years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore I was displeased with this generation, and I said, They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!”<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “today,” lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin —<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end —<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> While it is said, “Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> For who provoked Him when they heard? Indeed was it not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And with whom was He displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest, except to the disobedient?<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. <br><br>
