How to add readings as of 8/28/2021 [might change later]:

day 244 = Sept 1 (Not a leap year)

To add a reading, create a new html file called n.html where n refers to the
nth day of reading. Ex: 245.html would be the reading for Sept 2.
(note: see calendar.txt for a table of which number
corresponds to which day of the month)

Copy and paste any already existing reading file. Then go into the Bible
folder and find the corresponding chapter. Copy and paste the chapter
into the "bible-text" section of the html file. Change the onclick link to 
the current chapter and current book.

Additionally, for documentation, please modify the top of the document
<!--Date: MM/DD--> to match the date of the current reading being entered.

Finally, when moving onto a different book (i.e. going from entering the last
chapter of Matthew to the last chapter of Mark) replace instances of the previous
book with the book you are on.

All parts that need to be modified are marked with
<!--CHANGE ME--> and <!--CHANGE ME (END)-->
