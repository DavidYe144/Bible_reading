	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land: Gilead as far as Dan;<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And all of Naphtali; and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; and all the land of Judah as far as the sea beyond <i>it;</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And the Negev; and the Plain, <i>that is,</i> the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jehovah said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it. I have let you see it with your <i>own</i> eyes, but you will not go over there.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab according to the word of Jehovah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial site to this day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor had his freshness left <i>him.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; thus, the days of weeping <i>and</i> mourning for Moses were completed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel listened to him and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And there has not arisen a prophet since then in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to all his land,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And for all the mighty power and for all the great terror which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.<br><br>
