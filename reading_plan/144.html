		<sup><b>41</b></sup> Then they took the stone away. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> Many of the Jews therefore who had come to Mary and beheld the things that He did believed into Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a council and said, What do we do? For this man is doing many signs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> If we let Him do so, all will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> Nor do you take account of the fact that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and that not the whole nation perish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> But this he did not say from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation,<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> And not for the nation only, but that He might also gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> From that day therefore they took counsel to kill Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with the disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> They then sought Jesus, and said to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That He will not, by any means, come to the feast?<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should disclose it, so that they might arrest Him.<br><br>
