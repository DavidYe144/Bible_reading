	<sup><b>7</b></sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.<br><br>
	<sup><b>8</b></sup> For finding fault with them He says, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,<br><br>
	<sup><b>9</b></sup> Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.<br><br>
	<sup><b>10</b></sup> For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.<br><br>
	<sup><b>11</b></sup> And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.<br><br>
	<sup><b>12</b></sup> For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>13</b></sup> In saying, A new covenant, He has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing. <br><br>

<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world.<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand and the table and the loaves that were set forth, which is called the Holy Place;<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> And after the second veil, a tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies,<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> Having a golden altar and the Ark of the Covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron’s rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant,<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the expiation cover, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship;<br><br>
	<sup><b>7</b></sup> But into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people,<br><br>
