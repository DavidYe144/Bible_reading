	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Meanwhile, when the myriads of the crowd were gathered together so that they trampled on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> But there is nothing covered up which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be known.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Therefore what you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And I say to you My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Moreover, I tell you, Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God;<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And everyone who will say a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how or what you should reply in defense, or what you should say;<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what should be said.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And someone out of the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But He said to him, Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to them, Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness, for no one’s life is in the abundance of his possessions.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have no place where I may gather my crops?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather there all my wheat and my goods.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> So is he who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat; nor for your body, what you should put on;<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> For the life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Consider the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn; yet God nourishes them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his stature?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> If then you cannot do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil nor even spin thread; but I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Now if God so arrays the grass in the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, you of little faith!<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And you, do not seek what you shall eat and what you shall drink, and do not be unsettled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> For all these things the Gentiles of the world are anxiously seeking, but your Father knows that you need these things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> However, seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where thief does not come near nor even moth corrupts;<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> For where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.<br><br>
