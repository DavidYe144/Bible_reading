	<p><sup><b>26</b></sup> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> To a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And he came to her and said, Rejoice, you who have been graced! The Lord is with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And she was greatly troubled at this saying and began reasoning what kind of greeting this might be.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father,<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> But Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I have not known a man?<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And behold, Elizabeth your relative, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who is called barren,<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> Because no word will be impossible with God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And Mary said, Behold, the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And Mary rose up in those days and went to the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And entered into the house of Zachariah and greeted Elizabeth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And how has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped with exultation in my womb.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> And blessed is she who has believed, because there will be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior;<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave. For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed,<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> Because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> And His mercy is unto generations and generations, unto those who fear Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> He has exercised might with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> He has brought down potentates from thrones and has exalted the humble;<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> He has upheld Israel His servant to remember mercy,<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.<br><br>
