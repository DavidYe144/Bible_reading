		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And it turned toward the rising of the sun to Beth-dagon, and reached Zebulun and the valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel, and went to Cabul on the north<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah as far as Great Sidon;<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And the border turned to Ramah and as far as the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah; and its end was at the sea at the region of Achzib;<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And Ummah and Aphek and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> For the children of Naphtali the sixth lot came out, for the children of Naphtali according to their families.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel unto Lakkum; and its end was the Jordan;<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor, and went from there to Hukkok, and reached Zebulun on the south, and reached Asher on the west and Judah at the Jordan toward the rising of the sun;<br><br>

		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And Me-jarkon and Rakkon with the border opposite Japho.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> When the territory of the children of Dan was lost to them, the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem; and they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword; and they took possession of it and inhabited it; and they called Leshem Dan, according to the name of Dan their father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> This was the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> So they finished distributing the land as inheritances according to its borders. And the children of Israel gave Joshua the son of Nun an inheritance in the midst of them;<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> According to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city that he asked for, <i>that is,</i> Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the city and dwelt in it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the tribes of the children of Israel gave as inheritances by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.<br><br>
