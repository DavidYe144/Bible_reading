		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And He rose up from there and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entering into a house, He wanted no one to know about it; yet He could not escape notice.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and immediately she came and fell at His feet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Now the woman was a Greek, Syrophoenician by race. And she asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And He said to her, First let the children be satisfied, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, but even the little dogs under the table eat of the little children’s crumbs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And He said to her, Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And she went away to her house and found the little child lying on the couch and the demon gone out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And again He came out of the borders of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the midst of the borders of Decapolis.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And they brought to Him one who was deaf and who spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him to lay His hand on him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And He took him aside from the crowd privately and put His fingers into his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And looking up to heaven, He groaned and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond on his tongue was released and he spoke clearly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And He charged them not to tell anyone. But the more He charged them, so much the more they proclaimed it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And they were utterly astounded, saying, He has done all things well; He makes both the deaf hear and the dumb speak. <br><br>
