	<p>			 
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ?<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> They sought then to seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the Jews in dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come?<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> The attendants answered, Never has a man spoken as this man has.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Has any one of the rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.<br><br>
