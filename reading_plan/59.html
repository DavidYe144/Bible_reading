	<p>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And they went out from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> For He was teaching His disciples. And He said to them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, after three days He will rise.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> But they did not understand this saying and were afraid to question Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And they came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house, He questioned them, What were you reasoning about on the way?<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And they were silent, for they had argued with one another on the way about who was greater.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And He sat down and called the twelve and said to them, If anyone wants to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And He took a little child and set him in their midst; and taking him into His arms, He said to them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> Whoever receives one of such little children because of My name, receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> John said to Him, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for there is no one who will do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> For he who is not against us is for us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name that you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he shall by no means lose his reward.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is better for him if a great millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> [Some MSS insert v. 44, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.]<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> And if your foot stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> [Some MSS insert v. 46, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.]<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And if your eye stumbles you, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> For everyone shall be salted with fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> Salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you restore its saltiness? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another. <br><br>
