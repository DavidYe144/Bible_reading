	<p>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And in His name will the Gentiles hope.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.<br><br>
