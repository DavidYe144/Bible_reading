	<p><sup><b>10</b></sup> And when the apostles returned, they related to Him the things they had done. And taking them aside, He withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> But the crowds found out and followed Him, and He welcomed them and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God; and those who had need of healing He healed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and find provisions, because we are here in a deserted place.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But He said to them, You give them something to eat. But they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, Make them recline in groups of about fifty each.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And they did so and made them all recline.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And they ate and were all satisfied. And what was left over among them was taken up, twelve handbaskets of broken pieces.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And they answered and said, John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words, of this one will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.<br><br>
