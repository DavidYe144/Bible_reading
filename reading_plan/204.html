	<p>				 
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Because though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or thank Him, but rather became vain in their reasonings, and their heart, lacking understanding, was darkened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Professing to be wise, they became fools<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, so that they dishonor their bodies among themselves,<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Therefore God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature;<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And likewise also the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their craving toward one another, males with males committing unseemliness and fully receiving in themselves the retribution of their error which was due.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And even as they did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting,<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity;<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Whisperers, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Senseless, faithless, affectionless, merciless;<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them. <br><br>
