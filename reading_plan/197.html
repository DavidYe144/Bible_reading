  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jehovah said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh; for because of a mighty hand he will let them go, and because of a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land.<br><br>
    <sup><b>2</b></sup> And God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am Jehovah.<br><br>
    <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as the All-sufficient God; but by My name Jehovah I did not make Myself known to them.<br><br>
    <sup><b>4</b></sup> And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they sojourned.<br><br>
    <sup><b>5</b></sup> And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved; and I have remembered My covenant.<br><br>
    <sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.<br><br>
    <sup><b>7</b></sup> And I will take you to Myself as <i>My</i> people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, the One who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.<br><br>
    <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Jehovah.<br><br>
    <sup><b>9</b></sup> And Moses spoke this to the children of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of anguish of spirit and harsh bondage.<br><br>
    <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<br><br>
    <sup><b>11</b></sup> Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.<br><br>
    <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, The children of Israel do not now listen to me. How then will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am of uncircumcised lips?<br><br>
    <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and gave them a charge for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.<br><br>
    <sup><b>14</b></sup> These are the heads of their fathers’ houses. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.<br><br>
    <sup><b>15</b></sup> And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.<br><br>
    <sup><b>16</b></sup> And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the years of Levi’s life were one hundred thirty-seven years.<br><br>
    <sup><b>17</b></sup> The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.<br><br>
    <sup><b>18</b></sup> And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the years of Kohath’s life were one hundred thirty-three years.<br><br>
    <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.<br><br>
    <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Amram took Jochebed his father’s sister for himself as wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the years of Amram’s life were one hundred thirty-seven years.<br><br>
    <sup><b>21</b></sup> And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.<br><br>
    <sup><b>22</b></sup> And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.<br><br>
    <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, for himself as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.<br><br>
    <sup><b>24</b></sup> And the sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.<br><br>
    <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the Levites according to their families.<br><br>
    <sup><b>26</b></sup> It was <i>this same</i> Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.<br><br>
    <sup><b>27</b></sup> It was they who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt; it is <i>the same</i> Moses and Aaron.<br><br>
    <sup><b>28</b></sup> And on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,<br><br>
    <sup><b>29</b></sup> Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak to you.<br><br>
    <sup><b>30</b></sup> But Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How then will Pharaoh listen to me?<br><br>
