	<p><sup><b>13</b></sup> Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And while they were staying some additional days there, Festus laid before the king the matters regarding Paul, saying, There is a certain man who has been left a prisoner by Felix,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> To them I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a defense concerning the charge.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no charge of the evil things I was suspecting.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> But they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And being at a loss as to how there should be an inquiry concerning these things, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him up to Caesar.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said Festus, you shall hear him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him. <br><br>
