	<p>				 
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> From now on I am telling you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe that I am.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I shall send receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in His spirit, and He testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> The disciples looked at one another, perplexed over whom He was speaking about.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining on Jesus’ bosom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Then he, while reclining thus on Jesus’ breast, said to Him, Lord, who is it?<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Jesus answered, It is he for whom I will dip the morsel and to whom I will give it. And dipping the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And at that moment, after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, What you do, do quickly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But none of those reclining at table knew why He said this to him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For some supposed, since Judas held the purse, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy the things that we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Therefore having taken the morsel, he went out immediately; and it was night.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Then when he went out, Jesus said, Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Little children, I am still with you a little while; you will seek Me, and even as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you cannot come, now I say to you also.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered him, Where I go you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> Peter said to Him, Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times.<br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> In My Father’s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And where I am going you know the way.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.<br><br>
