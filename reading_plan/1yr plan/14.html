	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields. And His disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But if you knew what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned the guiltless.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said to them, What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out and it was restored, as sound as the other.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all;<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And He charged them not to make Him known,<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> “Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.<br><br>
