	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And after taking counsel, they bought with it the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that had been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel had priced,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, It is as you say.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And they had at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let Him be crucified!<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> But he said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man’s blood. You see to it yourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And all the people answered and said, His blood be upon us and upon our children!<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered about Him the whole cohort.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And they wove a crown of thorns and placed it on His head and put a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews!<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And they spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this one they compelled to take up His cross.<br><br>
