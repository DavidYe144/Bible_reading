	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> For they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult by the people.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And while He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined at table, a woman came, having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard, and she broke the alabaster flask and poured it over His head.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment been made?<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they were infuriated with her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a noble deed on Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And when they heard this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money. And he sought a way to deliver Him up opportunely.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You want us to go and prepare so that You may eat the passover?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him;<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is My guest room, where I may eat the passover with My disciples?<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. And there prepare for us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And the disciples went out and came into the city and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And when evening fell, He came with the twelve.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me, one who is eating with Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, Surely not I?<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said to them, It will be one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the dish.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> For the Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And as they were eating, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them; and they all drank of it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And He said to them, This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Truly I say to you, I shall by no means drink of the product of the vine anymore until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br><br>
