	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.<br><br>
			<sup><b>2</b></sup> But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.<br><br>
			<sup><b>3</b></sup> And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?<br><br>
			<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray.<br><br>
			<sup><b>5</b></sup> For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.<br><br>
			<sup><b>6</b></sup> And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet.<br><br>
			<sup><b>7</b></sup> For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.<br><br>
			<sup><b>8</b></sup> All these things are the beginning of birth pangs.<br><br>
			<sup><b>9</b></sup> Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name.<br><br>
			<sup><b>10</b></sup> And at that time many will be stumbled and will deliver up one another and will hate one another.<br><br>
			<sup><b>11</b></sup> And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray.<br><br>
			<sup><b>12</b></sup> And because lawlessness will be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold.<br><br>
			<sup><b>13</b></sup> But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.<br><br>
			<sup><b>14</b></sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.<br><br>
			<sup><b>15</b></sup> Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand), <br><br>
			<sup><b>16</b></sup> Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;<br><br>
			<sup><b>17</b></sup> Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house;<br><br>
			<sup><b>18</b></sup> And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment.<br><br>
			<sup><b>19</b></sup> But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days.<br><br>
			<sup><b>20</b></sup> And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath,<br><br>
			<sup><b>21</b></sup> For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.<br><br>
			<sup><b>22</b></sup> And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short.<br><br>
			<sup><b>23</b></sup> At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it.<br><br>
			<sup><b>24</b></sup> For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.<br><br>
			<sup><b>25</b></sup> Behold, I have told you beforehand.<br><br>
			<sup><b>26</b></sup> Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it.<br><br>
