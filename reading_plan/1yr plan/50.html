	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And they came to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And when He came out of the boat, immediately, from out of the tombs, a man with an unclean spirit met Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him any longer, not even with a chain,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And continually night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he cried out and gashed himself with stones.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And crying out with a loud voice, he said, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For He had said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And He questioned him, What is your name? And he said to Him, Legion is my name, because we are many.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And he entreated Him much not to send them out of the region.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Now there on the mountainside was a great herd of hogs feeding.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And they entreated Him, saying, Send us to the hogs, so that we may enter into them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And He gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the hogs, and the herd, about two thousand, rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And those who were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside. And they came to see what had happened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting down, clothed, and sane, the man who had had the legion, and they became frightened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And those who had seen it related to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man and concerning the hogs.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And they began to entreat Him to depart from their borders.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And as He got into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might stay with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And He did not allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him, and all marveled.<br><br>
