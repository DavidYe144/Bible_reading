	<p><sup><b>17</b></sup> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> But Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave;<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.<br><br>
