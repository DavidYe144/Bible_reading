	<p>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And they came to Jericho. And as He was going out from Jericho, as well as His disciples and a large crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, sat by the road.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> And many rebuked him so that he would be silent, but he cried out much more, Son of David, have mercy on me!<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> And Jesus, standing still, said, Call him here. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Take courage. Rise. He is calling you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> And throwing his garment aside, he leaped up and came to Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> And Jesus answered him and said, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight!<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, Go; your faith has healed you. And immediately he received his sight and followed Him on the road. <br><br>
	</p>
	<h4 id="mark-11"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '../bible/40-matthew.html')">Mark 11</a></h4>
	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when they drew near to Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And said to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately upon entering into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has yet sat; untie it and bring it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of it and will immediately send it here again.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And they went away and found a colt tied by a door, outside on the street, and they untied it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And some of the ones standing there said to them, What are you doing untying the colt?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And they spoke to them even as Jesus had said. And they let them do it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and He sat on it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And many spread their garments in the road, and others spread layers of branches full of tender leaves, having cut them out of the fields.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And those who went before and those who followed cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And He entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when He had looked around at all things, since the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.<br><br>
