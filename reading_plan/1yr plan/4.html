	<p><sup><b>12</b></sup> Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.<br><br>
	<sup><b>13</b></sup> And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is beside the sea in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,<br><br>
	<sup><b>14</b></sup> In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<br><br>
	<sup><b>15</b></sup> “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:<br><br>
	<sup><b>16</b></sup> The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>17</b></sup> From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<br><br>
	<sup><b>18</b></sup> And while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.<br><br>
	<sup><b>19</b></sup> And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.<br><br>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> And great crowds followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.<br><br>
    </p>
	<h4 id="matthew-1"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '../bible/40-matthew.html')">Matthew 5</a></h4>
	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when He saw the crowds, He went up to the mountain. And after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying,<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.<br><br>
	<sup><b>7</b></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.<br><br>
	<sup><b>8</b></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>9</b></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>10</b></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.<br><br>
	<sup><b>11</b></sup> Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.<br><br>
	<sup><b>12</b></sup> Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<br><br>
