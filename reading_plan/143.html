	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> The sisters therefore sent to Him saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> He said these things, and after this He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> So Jesus then told them plainly, Lazarus has died.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary sat in the house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and is calling you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And she, when she heard this, rose quickly and came to Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> The Jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Then Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was moved with indignation in His spirit and was troubled,<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Jesus wept.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> The Jews then said, Behold how He loved him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> But some of them said, Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die?<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> Jesus therefore, moved with indignation again in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?<br><br>
