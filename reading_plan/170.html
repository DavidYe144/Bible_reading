	<p><sup><b>48</b></sup> Yet the Most High does not dwell in that which is made by hands, even as the prophet says,<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> “Heaven is My throne, and the earth is a footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> Has not My hand made all these things?”<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always oppose the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you also do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand concerning the coming of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become,<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> You who received the law as ordinances of angels and did not keep it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> Now as they heard these things, they were exasperated and gnashed their teeth at him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> But they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and rushed upon him with one accord.<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> And they threw him outside of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> And they stoned Stephen as he called upon the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!<br><br>
		<sup><b>60</b></sup> And kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. <br><br>
   </p>
</div>
<div class="bible-text">
   <h4 id="acts-8"><a onclick="open_chapter('8', '../bible/44-acts.html')">Acts 8</a></h4>
   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Saul approved of his killing. And there occurred in that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> But Saul was devastating the church, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he delivered them to prison.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the crowds gave heed with one accord to the things said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he did.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For with many of those who had unclean spirits, the spirits came out crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And there was much joy in that city.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And a certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and had been amazing the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> To him they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the power of God which is called Great.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And they gave heed to him because for a considerable time he had amazed them with his magic.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> But when they believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And even Simon himself believed, and once he had been baptized, he continued steadfastly with Philip. And as he beheld the signs and great works of power taking place, he was amazed.<br><br>
