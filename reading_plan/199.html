	<p><sup><b>30</b></sup> And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them;<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And when they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying, This man is doing nothing worthy of death or of bonds.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, had he not appealed to Caesar. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan cohort.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And going on board an Adramyttian ship which was about to sail to places along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And having sailed across the open sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us onto it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And when we had sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go on, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is to be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> But the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship’s owner rather than by the things that were being said by Paul.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there.<br><br>
