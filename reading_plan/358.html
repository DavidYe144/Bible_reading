	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire and those who come away victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And they sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in heaven was opened,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished. <br><br>
