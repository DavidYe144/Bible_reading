	<sup><b>18</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like shining bronze:<br><br>
	<sup><b>19</b></sup> I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first.<br><br>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works;<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> And her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works.<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> But I say to you — the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say — I put no other burden upon you;<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father;<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> And to him I will give the morning star.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. <br><br>
</p>

<h4 id="revelation-3"><a onclick="open_chapter('3', '../bible/66-revelation.html')">Revelation 3</a></h4>
<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars:        I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.<br><br>
	<sup><b>2</b></sup> Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>3</b></sup> Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you.<br><br>
	<sup><b>4</b></sup> But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy.<br><br>
	<sup><b>5</b></sup> He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.<br><br>
	<sup><b>6</b></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.<br><br>
