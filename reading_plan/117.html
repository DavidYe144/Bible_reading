	<p><sup><b>37</b></sup> Now during the day He was in the temple teaching, but during the night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And all the people would come early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to do away with Him, for they feared the people.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot and was of the number of the twelve.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers as to how he might deliver Him up to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And they rejoiced and promised to give him money.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And he consented and sought opportunity to deliver Him up to them apart from the crowd.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover had to be sacrificed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare it?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And He told them, Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And that one will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare there.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And they left and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the apostles with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And He received a cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For I tell you, I shall by no means drink from now on of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And they began to discuss among themselves who then of them it was who was about to do this.<br><br>
