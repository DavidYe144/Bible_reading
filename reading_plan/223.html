	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please ourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Let each of us please his neighbor with a view to what is good for building up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> For Christ also did not please Himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> For the things that were written previously were written for our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God’s truthfulness, to confirm the promises given to the fathers,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, “Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And again he says, “Rejoice, Gentiles, with His people.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples speak praise to Him.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And again, Isaiah says, “There shall be the root of Jesse, even He who rises to rule the Gentiles; on Him will the Gentiles hope.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
