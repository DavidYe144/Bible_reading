	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> After these things Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And a great crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He did on those who were sick.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there with His disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea,<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.<br><br>
