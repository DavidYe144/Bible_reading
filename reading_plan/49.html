		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And He said to them, Does the lamp come so that it may be placed under the bushel or under the bed? Does it not come that it may be placed on the lampstand?<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> For nothing is hidden except that it may be manifested, nor has anything become concealed but that it may come into the open.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you, and it shall be added to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> For he who has, it shall be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And He said, So is the kingdom of God: as if a man cast seed on the earth,<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens — how, he does not know.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> The earth bears fruit by itself: first a blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And He said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we present it?<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the herbs and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shade.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And in many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear;<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And without a parable He did not speak to them; but privately to His own disciples He explained all things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And He said to them on that day when evening had fallen, Let us go over to the other side.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And leaving the crowd, they took Him along, just as He was, in the boat; and other boats were with Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And there arose a great windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And having awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> And He said to them, Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> And they became greatly frightened and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him? <br><br>
