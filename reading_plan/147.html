  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when men began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to them,<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from all whom they chose.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And Jehovah said, My Spirit will not strive with man forever, for he indeed is flesh; so his days will be one hundred twenty years.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> The Nephilim were on the earth in those days — and also afterward — when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; these were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah repented that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him in His heart.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> And Jehovah said, I will blot out the man whom I have created from the surface of the ground, from man to beast to creeping things to the birds of heaven; for I repent that I have made them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But Noah found favor in the sight of Jehovah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generations; <i>and</i> Noah walked with God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and now I am about to destroy them with the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make rooms in the ark and shall cover it within and without with pitch.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> You shall make an opening for light for the ark, and you shall finish it up to a cubit from the top; and you shall put the entrance of the ark in its side; you shall make it with lower, second, and third <i>stories.</i><br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And now I am about to bring a flood of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And of every living thing, of all flesh, two of every <i>kind</i> you shall bring into the ark to preserve <i>them</i> alive with you; they shall be male and female.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Of the birds according to their kind and of the cattle according to their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every <i>kind</i> will come to you in order to preserve <i>them</i> alive.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And for your part, take some of every <i>kind</i> of food that is edible, and gather <i>it</i> to yourself, and it will be for food for you and for them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Noah did <i>this;</i> according to all that God commanded him, so he did.<br><br>
