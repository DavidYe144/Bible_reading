	<p>				 
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me;<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> And he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> I have come as a light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And if anyone hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> For I have not spoken from Myself; but the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given Me commandment, what to say and what to speak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> And I know that His commandment is eternal life. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak.<br><br>

   <h4 id="john-13"><a onclick="open_chapter('13', '../bible/43-john.html')">John 13</a></h4>
   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And while supper was taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Rose from supper and laid aside His outer garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> He came then to Simon Peter. Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Peter said to Him, You shall by no means wash my feet forever. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For He knew the one betraying Him; for this reason He said, Not all of you are clean.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Then when He had washed their feet and taken His outer garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> You call Me the Teacher and the Lord, and you say rightly, for I am.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> For I have given you an example so that you also may do even as I have done to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, A slave is not greater than his master, nor one who is sent greater than the one who sends him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.<br><br>
