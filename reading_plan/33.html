	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses’ seat;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their garments,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And they love the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called by men, Rabbi.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And the greatest among you shall be your servant.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the widows’ houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers. For this reason you shall receive greater judgment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it;<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.<br><br>
