	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Praying at the same time for us also, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ (because of which also I am bound),<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> All the things concerning me, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you might know the things concerning us and that he might comfort your hearts;<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> With Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all the things here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as well as Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, (concerning whom you received commandments, If he comes to you, receive him),<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And Jesus, who is called Justus; these alone of the circumcision are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, ones who have become a consolation to me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> For I testify of him that he labors much for you and for those in Laodicea and for those in Hierapolis.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, as well as Demas.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Greet the brothers in Laodicea, as well as Nymphas and the church, which is in his house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> The greeting in my own hand — Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. <br><br>
