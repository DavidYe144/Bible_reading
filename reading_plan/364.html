	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And He who sits on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said, Write, for these words are faithful and true.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said to me, They have come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> But the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was, respectively, of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And its gates shall by no means be shut by day, for there will be no night there.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And anything common and he who makes an abomination and a lie shall by no means enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life. <br><br>
