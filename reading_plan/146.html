<p>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> And there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew came, and Philip too, and they told Jesus.<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour. But for this reason I have come to this hour.<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came out of heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> The crowd therefore which stood by and heard it said that there had been thunder; others said, An angel has spoken to Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> Jesus answered and said, This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sake.<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> But He said this signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> The crowd therefore answered Him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever; and how is it that You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> Jesus then said to them, The light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> While you have the light, believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light.        Jesus said these things, and He went away and was hidden from them.<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> But though He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe into Him,<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> That the word of the prophet Isaiah which he said might be fulfilled, “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> “He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart, that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn, and I will heal them.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> These things said Isaiah because he saw His glory and spoke concerning Him.<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> Nevertheless even many of the rulers believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue;<br><br>
	<sup><b>43</b></sup> For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.<br><br>
