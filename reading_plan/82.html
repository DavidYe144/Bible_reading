	<p><p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And as the crowd pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And He saw two boats lying by the lake, and the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing the nets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and from the boat taught the crowds.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And when He ceased speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And Simon answered and said, Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught nothing; but based on Your word I will let down the nets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And when they did this, they enclosed a great number of fish, and their nets began to tear apart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And they signaled to their companions in the other boat to come and assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> For amazement had taken possession of him and all who were with him, because of the catch of the fish which they took;<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And likewise also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching men alive.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And when they had brought the boats to the land, they left all and followed Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And while He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And He charged him to tell no one: But go away, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift for your cleansing, even as Moses directed, for a testimony to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> But the word concerning Him spread abroad all the more, and great crowds came together to hear Him and to be healed from their infirmities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> But He Himself often withdrew in the wilderness and prayed.<br><br>
