	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He said to them, Truly I say to you, there are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and brought them up alone into a high mountain privately. And He was transfigured before them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And His garments became sparkling, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were conversing with Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> For he did not know what to answer, for they had become extremely frightened.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone, but Jesus only with them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And as they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them not to relate to anyone the things which they had seen, except when the Son of Man has risen from the dead.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And they kept the word, discussing among themselves what rising from the dead was.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said to them, Elijah does indeed come first and restore all things. And how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He should suffer many things and be counted as nothing?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him the things that they wished, even as it is written of him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some scribes disputing with them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And immediately, when all the crowd saw Him, they were amazed, and they ran to Him and greeted Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And He questioned them, What are you disputing with them?<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And one from the crowd answered Him, Teacher, I brought to You my son, who has a dumb spirit;<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth; and he is wasting away. And I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And He answered them and said, O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And they brought him to Him. And when it saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him greatly, and falling on the earth, he rolled about, foaming at the mouth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And Jesus, seeing that a crowd was running together toward them, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out. And he became as though he were dead so that many said that he died.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him, and he stood up.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And when He entered into the house, His disciples questioned Him privately, Why were we not able to cast it out?<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And He said to them, This kind cannot come out by any means except prayer.<br><br>
