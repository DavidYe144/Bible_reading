	<p>				 
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> I do not ask that You would take them out of the world, but that You would keep them out of the hands of the evil one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And for their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word,<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one;<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Righteous Father, though the world has not known You, yet I have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And I have made Your name known to them and will yet make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.<br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> When Jesus had said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered as well as His disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus often gathered there with His disciples.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Then Judas, having gotten the cohort and some attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek?<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. He said to them, I am. And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Then again He asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Jesus answered, I told you that I am; if therefore you seek Me, let these go away,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> That the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?<br><br>
