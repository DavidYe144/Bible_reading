	<p>				 
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> But I give you this charge and do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and put those to shame who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord’s death until He comes.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come. <br><br>
