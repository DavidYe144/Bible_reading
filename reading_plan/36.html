	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And five of them were foolish and five were prudent.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master’s money.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And he who had received the two talents also came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
