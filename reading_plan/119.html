	<p>				 
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> And a certain servant girl, seeing him seated in the light of the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was with Him too.<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> But he denied it, saying, I do not know Him, woman.<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> And after a short time, another person, seeing him, said, You also are one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not!<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> And after about one hour had passed, another one insisted, saying, Surely this man was also with Him, for he is also a Galilean.<br><br>
		<sup><b>60</b></sup> But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>61</b></sup> And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.<br><br>
		<sup><b>62</b></sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>63</b></sup> And the men who were holding Him mocked Him and beat Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>64</b></sup> And they blindfolded Him and questioned Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>65</b></sup> And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming.<br><br>
		<sup><b>66</b></sup> And when it became day, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>67</b></sup> If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you shall by no means believe;<br><br>
		<sup><b>68</b></sup> And if I ask you, you shall by no means answer.<br><br>
		<sup><b>69</b></sup> But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>70</b></sup> And they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say rightly that I am.<br><br>
		<sup><b>71</b></sup> And they said, What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His mouth. <br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the entire multitude of them rose up and led Him before Pilate.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding people to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no fault in this man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> But they were vehement, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And when he realized that He was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod, who also himself was in Jerusalem in those days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly, for he had wanted to see Him for a considerable time, because he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some sign done by Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And Herod with his soldiers, having despised Him and mocked Him, threw around Him splendid clothing and sent Him back to Pilate.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that very day, for they had previously been at enmity toward each other.<br><br>
