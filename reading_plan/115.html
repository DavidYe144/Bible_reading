	<p>
	<sup><b>20</b></sup> And they watched Him closely and sent spies who feigned themselves to be righteous, in order that they might lay hold on some word of His, so as to deliver Him up to the rule and authority of the governor.<br><br>
	<sup><b>21</b></sup> And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and do not accept man’s person, but teach the way of God in truth.<br><br>
	<sup><b>22</b></sup> Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?<br><br>
	<sup><b>23</b></sup> But He perceived their craftiness and said to them,<br><br>
	<sup><b>24</b></sup> Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? And they said, Caesar’s.<br><br>
	<sup><b>25</b></sup> And He said to them, Therefore render the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar, and the things that are God’s to God.<br><br>
	<sup><b>26</b></sup> And they were not able to lay hold of a saying of His in the presence of the people; and marveling at His answer, they kept silent.<br><br>
	<sup><b>27</b></sup> And some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,<br><br>
	<sup><b>28</b></sup> Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If anyone’s brother has a wife and dies, and this one is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.<br><br>
	<sup><b>29</b></sup> There were then seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died childless;<br><br>
	<sup><b>30</b></sup> And the second;<br><br>
	<sup><b>31</b></sup> And the third took her; and similarly the seven also did not leave children and died.<br><br>
	<sup><b>32</b></sup> Finally the woman also died.<br><br>
	<sup><b>33</b></sup> In the resurrection, therefore, which one’s wife does the woman become? For the seven had her as wife.<br><br>
	<sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,<br><br>
	<sup><b>35</b></sup> But those who are counted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage;<br><br>
	<sup><b>36</b></sup> For neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to angels, and they are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.<br><br>
	<sup><b>37</b></sup> But that the dead are raised, even Moses disclosed in the section concerning the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.<br><br>
	<sup><b>38</b></sup> Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all men are living.<br><br>
	<sup><b>39</b></sup> And some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have spoken well.<br><br>
	<sup><b>40</b></sup> For they no longer dared to question Him about anything.<br><br>
	<sup><b>41</b></sup> And He said to them, How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?<br><br>
	<sup><b>42</b></sup> For David himself says in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,<br><br>
	<sup><b>43</b></sup> Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”<br><br>
	<sup><b>44</b></sup> David therefore calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?<br><br>
	<sup><b>45</b></sup> And as all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,<br><br>
	<sup><b>46</b></sup> Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at the dinners,<br><br>
	<sup><b>47</b></sup> Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment. <br><br>
