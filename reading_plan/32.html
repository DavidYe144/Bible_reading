	<p>				 
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother;<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And last of all the woman died.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And He said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> This is the great and first commandment.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And the second is like it: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David’s.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet”?<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.<br><br>
