	<p><sup><b>28</b></sup> Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium, and it was early morning. And they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the passover.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Pilate therefore went outside to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> They answered and said to him, If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered Him to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Pilate said then to them, You take Him and judge Him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone,<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was to die.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called for Jesus. And he said to Him, You are the King of the Jews?<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> Jesus answered, Are you saying this of yourself, or did others tell you about Me?<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your nation and its chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> Pilate said therefore to Him, So then You are a king? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> Pilate said to Him, What is truth?        And having said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, I find no fault in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> But you have a custom that I release one man to you at the Passover. Is it your will therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> Then they cried out again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.<br><br>

   <h4 id="john-19"><a onclick="open_chapter('19', '../bible/43-john.html')">John 19</a></h4>
   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Therefore at that time Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they threw a purple garment around Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And they came to Him and said, Rejoice, King of the Jews! and slapped Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And Pilate went outside again and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you that you may know that I find no fault in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Then Jesus came out, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he said to them, Behold, the man!<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> When Pilate therefore heard this word, he became frightened the more,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And he entered into the praetorium again and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore Pilate said to Him, You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and I have authority to crucify You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> Jesus answered him, You would have no authority against Me if it were not given to you from above; for this reason, he who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin.<br><br>
