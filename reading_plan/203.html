	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Through whom we have received grace and apostleship unto the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of His name,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Among whom you also are the called ones of Jesus Christ;<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, the called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Beseeching if by any means now at last I may be prospered in the will of God to come to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be established;<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> That is, that I with you may be encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I purposed to come to you (yet was hindered until the present), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish;<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> So, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also who are in Rome.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith, as it is written, “But the righteous shall have life and live by faith.”<br><br>
