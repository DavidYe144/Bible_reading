	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who has begotten loves him also who has been begotten of Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world — our faith.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And who is he who overcomes the world except him who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For there are three who testify,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> The Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one thing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And this is the boldness which we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him, to those sinning not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say that he should make request concerning that.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin, but he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Little children, guard yourselves from idols. <br><br>
