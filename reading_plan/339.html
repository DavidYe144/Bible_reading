	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when Jabin the king of Hazor heard of <i>this,</i> he sent <i>word</i> to Jobab the king of Madon and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And to the kings who were on the north in the hill country and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth and in the lowland and in the highland of Dor on the west;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> To the Canaanites on the east and on the west; and the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country; and the Hivites under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And they went out, they and all their camps with them, a people as great as the sand on the seashore in number, and very many horses and chariots.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And all these kings met together, and they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight with Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Then Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver all of them up slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> So Joshua and all the people of war with him went against them at the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fell on them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them and pursued them to Great Sidon and to Misrephoth-maim and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. And they struck them until no survivor was left to them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> So Joshua did to them according to what Jehovah had spoken to him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Then Joshua returned at that time and took Hazor, and he struck its king with the sword; for Hazor had formerly been the head of all these kingdoms.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And they struck every soul that was in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying <i>it;</i> nothing that breathed was left. And he burned Hazor with fire.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And all the cities of these kings with all their kings, Joshua took; and he struck them with the edge of the sword <i>and</i> utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> However as for all the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them except Hazor alone; Joshua burned <i>it.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the children of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them; they left nothing that breathed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> As Jehovah had commanded Moses His servant, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> So Joshua took all that land, the hill country and all the Negev and all the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country of Israel and its lowland;<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> From Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir, unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. And he took all their kings and struck them and put them to death.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Joshua made war with all these kings a long time.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in battle.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> For it was of Jehovah to harden their heart to meet Israel in battle so that He might utterly destroy them <i>and</i> that they might not receive mercy <i>but</i> be destroyed as Jehovah commanded Moses.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And Joshua went at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and all the hill country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did some remain.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> So Joshua took the whole land according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land had rest from war.<br><br>
