	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was near.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> For not even His brothers believed into Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> The Jews therefore sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, without ever having studied?<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.<br><br>
