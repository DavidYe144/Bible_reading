	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to Him when they had come from Jerusalem<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And had seen that some of His disciples ate bread with common hands, that is, unwashed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> (For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they carefully wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders;<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And when they come from the marketplace, unless they wash themselves, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dipping of cups and pitchers and copper vessels.)<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes questioned Him, Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with common hands?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And He said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> While leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And He said to them, You nicely set aside the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> For Moses said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> But you say: If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now corban (that is, a gift to God),<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Allow him to no longer do anything for his father or his mother.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Thus you deprive the word of God of its authority by your tradition which you have handed down. And many things similar to these you do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And He called the crowd to Him again and said to them, Hear Me, all of you, and understand.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> There is nothing outside of a man which entering into him can defile him, but the things coming out of a man are the things which defile a man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And when He entered into a house from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him concerning the parable.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And He said to them, Are you also in the same manner without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that enters from outside into a man is not able to defile him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the stomach, and goes out into the drain? (In saying this, He made all foods clean.)<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said, That which goes out of the man, that defiles the man.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders,<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man.<br><br>
