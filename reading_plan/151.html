	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them. Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me;<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me?<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.<br><br>
