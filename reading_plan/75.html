	<p><sup><b>57</b></sup> Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the little child, and they tried to call him after the name of his father, Zachariah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>60</b></sup> Yet his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.<br><br>
		<sup><b>61</b></sup> And they said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.<br><br>
		<sup><b>62</b></sup> And they gestured to his father as to what he would want him to be called.<br><br>
		<sup><b>63</b></sup> And asking for a tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all marveled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>64</b></sup> And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>65</b></sup> And fear came on all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these things were spread about.<br><br>
		<sup><b>66</b></sup> And all who heard these things put them in their heart, saying, What then will this little child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>67</b></sup> And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>68</b></sup> Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people,<br><br>
		<sup><b>69</b></sup> And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant,<br><br>
		<sup><b>70</b></sup> Even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old —<br><br>
		<sup><b>71</b></sup> Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,<br><br>
		<sup><b>72</b></sup> To accomplish mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,<br><br>
		<sup><b>73</b></sup> The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,<br><br>
		<sup><b>74</b></sup> To grant us that we, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,<br><br>
		<sup><b>75</b></sup> In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.<br><br>
		<sup><b>76</b></sup> And you also, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,<br><br>
		<sup><b>77</b></sup> To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins,<br><br>
		<sup><b>78</b></sup> Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high,<br><br>
		<sup><b>79</b></sup> To shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br><br>
		<sup><b>80</b></sup> And the little child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel. <br><br>
