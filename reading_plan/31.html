	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And he sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> But they disregarded it and went off, one to his own field and another to his business,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the rest took hold of his slaves, treated them shamefully, and killed them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And the king became angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were not worthy.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding feast was filled with those reclining at table.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment,<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> For many are called but few are chosen.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His words.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true and that You teach the way of God in truth and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Tell us therefore, What do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites?<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Show Me the coin for the tribute. And they brought to Him a denarius.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription?<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> They said, Caesar’s. Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar and the things that are God’s to God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left Him and went away.<br><br>
