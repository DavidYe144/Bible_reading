	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed:<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly;<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time,<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> Be sober; watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But the God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying fully that this is the true grace of God; enter into this grace and stand in it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> The co-chosen in Babylon and Mark my son greet you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ. <br><br>
