	<p>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> These things I have spoken to you in parables; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will report to you plainly concerning the Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you,<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> I came forth out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> His disciples said, Behold, now You are speaking plainly and not saying any parable.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.<br><br>

   <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You;<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> I have glorified You on earth, finishing the work which You have given Me to do.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Now they have come to know that all that You have given Me is from You,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> For the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them and knew truly that I came forth from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> I ask concerning them; I do not ask concerning the world, but concerning those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours;<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And all that is Mine is Yours, and Yours Mine; and I have been glorified in them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And I am no longer in the world; yet they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> When I was with them, I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me, and I guarded them; and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world that they may have My joy made full in themselves.<br><br>
