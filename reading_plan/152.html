  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And the whole earth had one language and the same speech.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And as they journeyed east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks and burn <i>them</i> thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had tar for mortar.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top is in the heavens; and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the surface of the whole earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men had built.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language; and this is <i>only</i> the beginning of what they will do; and now nothing which they purpose to do will be kept from them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Come, let Us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> So Jehovah scattered them from there over the surface of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Jehovah confounded the language of all the earth, and from there Jehovah scattered them over the surface of all the earth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old when he begot Arpachshad, two years after the flood.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And Shem lived after he had begotten Arpachshad five hundred years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and begot Shelah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> And Arpachshad lived after he had begotten Shelah four hundred three years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And Shelah lived thirty years and begot Eber.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Shelah lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred three years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And Eber lived thirty-four years and begot Peleg.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred thirty years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred nine years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And Reu lived thirty-two years and begot Serug.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred seven years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor two hundred years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and begot Terah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> And Nahor lived after he had begotten Terah one hundred nineteen years, and he begot <i>more</i> sons and daughters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> And Sarai was barren; she had no child.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went out together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran they settled there.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> And the days of Terah were two hundred five years, and Terah died in Haran.<br><br>
