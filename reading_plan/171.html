	<p><sup><b>14</b></sup> Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Who went down and prayed for them so that they might receive the Holy Spirit;<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> But when Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the Spirit was given, he offered them money, saying,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> Give me also this authority that on whomever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> But Peter said to him, May your silver go with you into destruction, because you thought that you would acquire the gift of God through money.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> You have no part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you;<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And Simon answered and said, You beseech the Lord on my behalf, so that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> They therefore, having solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem; and they announced the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is the desert route.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> And he rose up and went. And behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, a man in power under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> And he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> And when Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, Do you really know the things that you are reading?<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And he said, How could I unless someone guides me? And he entreated Philip to come up and sit with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: “As a sheep He was led to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beseech you, Concerning whom does the prophet say this? Concerning himself or concerning someone else?<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he announced Jesus as the gospel to him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And as they were going along the road, they came upon some water, and the eunuch said, Look, water. What prevents me from being baptized?<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, you will be saved. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And he ordered the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away; and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way rejoicing.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he announced the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea. <br><br>
