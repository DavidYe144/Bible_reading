	<p>				 
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And He told a parable to those who had been invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the places of honor, saying to them,<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not recline in the place of honor, lest someone more honorable than you may have been invited by him,<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And he who invited you and him come and say to you, Give this one that place; and then you begin with shame to occupy the last place.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> But when you are invited, go and recline in the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, come up higher. Then you will have glory before all those reclining with you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And He said also to the one who had invited Him, When you make a morning meal or a dinner, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and it become a repayment to you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And you will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And one of those reclining at table with Him, hearing these things, said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And He said to him, A certain man was making a great dinner and invited many;<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And they all with one consent began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I need to go out and see it. I ask you, have me excused.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to prove them. I ask you, have me excused.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And another said, I have married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And the slave came up and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and told his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And the slave said, Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And the master said to the slave, Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> For I tell you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.<br><br>
