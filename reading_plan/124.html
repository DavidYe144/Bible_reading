	<p><sup><b>29</b></sup> The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> This is He of whom I said, A man is coming after me who has become ahead of me, because He was before me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> And I did not know Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> And the two disciples heard him speak this, and they followed Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> And Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> He said to them, Come, and you will see. They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> One of the two who heard this from John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> The next day He wanted to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, Follow Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>46</b></sup> And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good be from Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> Nathanael said to Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.<br><br>
