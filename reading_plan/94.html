	<p><sup><b>46</b></sup> And reasoning came in among them as to which of them was greatest.<br><br>
		<sup><b>47</b></sup> And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, took hold of a little child and stood him beside Himself,<br><br>
		<sup><b>48</b></sup> And He said to them, Whoever receives this little child because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is least among you all, this one is great.<br><br>
		<sup><b>49</b></sup> And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.<br><br>
		<sup><b>50</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for he who is not against you is for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>51</b></sup> And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>52</b></sup> And He sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to prepare for Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>53</b></sup> And they did not receive Him, because His face was set to go to Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>54</b></sup> And seeing this, the disciples James and John said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?<br><br>
		<sup><b>55</b></sup> But turning, He rebuked them and said, You do not know of what kind of spirit you are.<br><br>
		<sup><b>56</b></sup> The Son of Man has not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them. And they went into another village.<br><br>
		<sup><b>57</b></sup> And as they went along the road, someone said to Him, I will follow You wherever You go.<br><br>
		<sup><b>58</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man does not have a place where He may lay His head.<br><br>
		<sup><b>59</b></sup> And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>60</b></sup> But He said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God everywhere.<br><br>
		<sup><b>61</b></sup> And another also said, I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say farewell to those in my house.<br><br>
		<sup><b>62</b></sup> But Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God. <br><br>
