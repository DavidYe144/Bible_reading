	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And when we parted from them and set sail, we took a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And when we sighted Cyprus and left it on the left, we sailed to Syria and came down to Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And when we had sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days. These told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And when we completed the days, we went forth and went on our way, with all of them, including the women and children, escorting us until we were outside the city. And when we had knelt down on the beach and prayed,<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> We took leave of one another and went on board the ship; and they returned home.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> And when we finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brothers and remained with them one day.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And on the next day we went forth and came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And while we remained there many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And he came to us and took Paul’s belt; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, In this way will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And when we heard these things, both we and those in that place entreated him not to go up to Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And since he would not be persuaded, we became silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And after these days we gathered our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing us to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And having greeted them, he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And when they heard it, they glorified God and said to him, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And they have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.<br><br>
