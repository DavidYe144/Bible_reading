	<p>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;<br><br>
		<sup><b>32</b></sup> And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.<br><br>
		<sup><b>33</b></sup> They answered Him, We are Abraham’s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free?<br><br>
		<sup><b>34</b></sup> Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.<br><br>
		<sup><b>35</b></sup> And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.<br><br>
		<sup><b>36</b></sup> If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.<br><br>
		<sup><b>37</b></sup> I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>38</b></sup> I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.<br><br>
		<sup><b>39</b></sup> They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.<br><br>
		<sup><b>40</b></sup> But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.<br><br>
		<sup><b>41</b></sup> You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>42</b></sup> Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>43</b></sup> Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.<br><br>
		<sup><b>44</b></sup> You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>45</b></sup> But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.<br><br>
