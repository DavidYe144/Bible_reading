	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He rose up from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and again crowds came together to Him, and as He was accustomed, again He taught them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And some Pharisees came and asked Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife, so as to tempt Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> And they said, Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and divorce her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> But from the beginning of creation, He made them male and female.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife;<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the two shall be one flesh. So then they are no longer two, but one flesh.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> And in the house the disciples questioned Him again concerning this.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And He said to them, Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> And they brought little children to Him so that He might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> But Jesus, seeing it, was indignant and said to them, Allow the little children to come to Me. Do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And taking them into His arms, He fervently blessed them, laying His hands on them.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And as He went out into the road, someone ran to Him and kneeling before Him asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One — God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> You know the commandments: “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.”<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And he said to Him, Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jesus, looking upon him, was moved with love for him and said to him, One thing you lack: go; the things you have, sell and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And at the word his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.<br><br>
		<sup><b>23</b></sup> And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples, How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!<br><br>
		<sup><b>24</b></sup> And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus again answered and said to them, Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!<br><br>
		<sup><b>25</b></sup> It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>26</b></sup> But they were astonished beyond measure and said among themselves, Then who can be saved?<br><br>
		<sup><b>27</b></sup> Looking upon them, Jesus said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>28</b></sup> Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You.<br><br>
		<sup><b>29</b></sup> Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel’s sake,<br><br>
		<sup><b>30</b></sup> But that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life.<br><br>
		<sup><b>31</b></sup> But many first will be last, and the last first.<br><br>
