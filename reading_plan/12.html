	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat there. And just then the kinsman of whom Boaz had spoken came by. And Boaz said, Turn aside <i>and</i> sit here, friend. And he turned aside and sat down.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And he took ten men from among the elders of the city and said, Sit here. And they sat down.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, has put up for sale the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> So I thought that I should disclose <i>this</i> to you and say, Buy <i>it</i> in the presence of those sitting <i>here</i> and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you can redeem <i>it,</i> redeem <i>it;</i> but if you cannot redeem <i>it,</i> tell me so that I will know; for there is no one to redeem <i>it</i> ahead of you, and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem <i>it.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from Naomi’s hand, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead man, in order to raise up the dead man’s name upon his inheritance.<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem <i>it</i> for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance. You redeem for yourself what I should redeem, for I cannot redeem <i>it.</i><br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Now such was <i>the custom</i> formerly in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging that to establish any matter a man would draw off his sandal and give <i>it</i> to his neighbor; this was <i>the way of</i> attesting <i>it</i> in Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> So when the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself, he drew off his sandal.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, You are witnesses today, that I buy from Naomi’s hand all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> Furthermore Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I acquire as my own wife so that I may raise up the dead man’s name upon his inheritance and the dead man’s name may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> And all the people who were in the gate and the elders said, <i>We are</i> witnesses. May Jehovah make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, the two who built the house of Israel. And prosper in Ephrathah, and gain a name in Bethlehem.<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, through the seed that Jehovah gives you by this young woman.<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and Jehovah made her conceive; and she bore a son.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah, who has not left you today without a kinsman; and may his name be famous in Israel.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And he will be to you as a restorer of life and a sustainer in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you <i>and</i> is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> And Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and she became his nurse.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> And the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, A son has been born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,<br><br>
		<sup><b>19</b></sup> And Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,<br><br>
		<sup><b>20</b></sup> And Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,<br><br>
		<sup><b>21</b></sup> And Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,<br><br>
		<sup><b>22</b></sup> And Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.<br><br>
