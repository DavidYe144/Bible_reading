	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions.<br><br>
		<sup><b>2</b></sup> And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.<br><br>
		<sup><b>3</b></sup> And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.<br><br>
		<sup><b>4</b></sup> I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own houses.<br><br>
		<sup><b>5</b></sup> And when he had called to him each one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?<br><br>
		<sup><b>6</b></sup> And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.<br><br>
		<sup><b>7</b></sup> Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.<br><br>
		<sup><b>8</b></sup> And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light.<br><br>
		<sup><b>9</b></sup> And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.<br><br>
		<sup><b>10</b></sup> He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.<br><br>
		<sup><b>11</b></sup> If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?<br><br>
		<sup><b>12</b></sup> And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own?<br><br>
		<sup><b>13</b></sup> No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.<br><br>
		<sup><b>14</b></sup> And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him.<br><br>
		<sup><b>15</b></sup> And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.<br><br>
		<sup><b>16</b></sup> The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it.<br><br>
		<sup><b>17</b></sup> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail.<br><br>
		<sup><b>18</b></sup> Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.<br><br>
