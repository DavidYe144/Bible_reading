	<p><sup><b>1</b></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>2</b></sup> He was in the beginning with God.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>3</b></sup> All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>4</b></sup> In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>5</b></sup> And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>6</b></sup> There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>7</b></sup> He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>8</b></sup> He was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>9</b></sup> This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>10</b></sup> He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>11</b></sup> He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>12</b></sup> But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,<br><br>
		 <sup><b>13</b></sup> Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>14</b></sup> And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>15</b></sup> John testified concerning Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who is coming after me has become ahead of me, because He was before me.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>16</b></sup> For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>17</b></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>18</b></sup> No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>19</b></sup> And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?<br><br>
		 <sup><b>20</b></sup> And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the Christ.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>22</b></sup> They said then to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?<br><br>
		 <sup><b>23</b></sup> He said, I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, “Make straight the way of the Lord!” as Isaiah the prophet said.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>24</b></sup> And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>25</b></sup> And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?<br><br>
		 <sup><b>26</b></sup> John answered them, saying, I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know,<br><br>
		 <sup><b>27</b></sup> He who is coming after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.<br><br>
		 <sup><b>28</b></sup> These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<br><br>
